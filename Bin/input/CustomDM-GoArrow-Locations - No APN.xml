It is a popular place, but not ever overcrowded deeper in (at least hardly). I suggest going in with a friend, but only one, because I went in once with a party of five or six, and it got a bit boring. &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 3/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great starter dungeon. Mostly low level drudges and shreth, bit tougher at the end. Once youre confident then go for the throne room.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Zulu Njomo 2/23/2001&lt;/i&gt;</description>

To get to Mayoi follow the right wall.  Hebian-To from the drop into the maze run straight in the direction the drop leaves you, just hit auto run in the portal, and don't turn at all!  Just bounce off the walls going straight and near the portal you will get hung up on a knife edge ""Y""...stop and take the right fork...the portal is right there.Now contains Drudge stalkers, lurkers and raveners. &lt;I&gt;-- Chupon 8/19/2004&lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;BR&gt;The first time you go through this dungeon, beware of the black things that dont show up on radar... *eg* &lt;I&gt;	-- Polecat 9/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The black things are Shadowchilds, creatures of the dark, very fast, very agile, and quite deadly.   There is a portal to the surface near the place you will meet them first, so you might consider running if you never faced them. &lt;I&gt;-- Saffron Dusk 9/15/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mosswarts, A chief, and lots of Shamen &lt;I&gt;-- Grunzio 9/18/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;on the bottom, where the shadow childs are, sometimes a ghost wisp, can cast magic really quick sometimes, so low levels beware &lt;I&gt;	-- Enyx 9/28/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great place to solo in your late teens. Bottom room you get mobbed by about five to six shamans, one chief, and one mudlurk. Blast! Decient selling loot. make about 10k a run (top to bottom)Bring your melee defense. &lt;I&gt;-- Sariel 4/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>drudges and outcasts. crowd in the basement not sure whats there. &lt;I&gt;	-- Guy Noir 1/4/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the screwyest Dungeon I think I have seen to date...  The entrance portal is guarded on the south and the west by Banderling Scouts and Young Banderlings as well as Green Phyntos Wasps, Outcast Monouga, Mite Snippets, and a few Shreth...  Inside, there are essentially 3 levels... the level you enter into has two or three Drudge Skulkers (lvl 2), one Drudge Slinker (lvl 4), and one Outcast Monouga...  This entry level also has a stamina fountain in the middle of it, but there are no chests and loot is minimal...  On the lower level (that is, down the ramp from the entry level), there are three Outcasts all gathered in one chamber, and a looped hallway that goes from one end of the chamber, behind the chamber, and to the other end of the chamber... in the hall are two Gnawer Shreths...  On this level of the dungeon there are also no chests, though I don't know about loot because I ran in, looked around, and left without killing anything...  On the upper level (that is, up the ramp from the entry level) there is a long hall with several side chambers (six I think)... all but one or two of those chambers have enemy creatures in them, and those creatures are usually in groups of 2-4 creatures...  There are mostly Drudge Sneakers (lvl 4 I think), but one of the chambers has two Outcasts and a chest...  only About half of these chambers have doors, so expect to get swarmed a bit...  The chest that I mentioned has low level cloths, and a little food...  At the end of the hall on this level, there is a locked gate (I have not yet found a key), and behind it there is a very small cavity with a single Drudge Sneaker and a chest... since I haven't found a key and I don't have a very good Lock Picking skill (only level 35), and since I haven't been able to kill everything on the level, I haven't been able to get into the chest or even through the door... in fact, I died three times trying before I gave up and decided I need to wait and go in with a group...  I recomend never going into this dungeon before level three, and only with at least one other person, unless you plan to stay on the bottom two levels...  When I have more info about the chest on the upper level, I will add it. &lt;I&gt;	-- ANM 3/28/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OK, I finally was able to open the locked gate on the top level (I used lockpick with a ""Reliable Lockpick"") and got into the chest (on the second attempt... after the first time, I died right before I got into the chest)...  This dungeon is not worth the trouble...  The chest contained all of 9 pyreals...  All this dungeon is worth is exp, and even that can be better recieved in other places...  Don't bother with this dungeon... ever! &lt;I&gt;	-- ANM 3/28/2001 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Camper Central &lt;I&gt;	-- Uncle Istvan 9/19/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wow its actually tough now!!! Mudlurks, Chiefs, Shamans, ton of traps &lt;I&gt;	-- Soltari  9/24/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of newbie campers now Level 20+ campers with SOLLs own the place. Still a long wait for the Green Mire even with the new upgrade. Same old place just higher level people. &lt;I&gt;	-- Axel 10/12/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just spent an a night here. As run up with the key to the lower level, there are 6 players waiting for somebody to open the door for them. The real sad thing is that several of them already had the damn ""jolly green giant"" armor on already. I just picked up the loot on the floor found my self encumbered and left. Sorry I didn't need to wait several hours for the armor. &lt;I&gt;	-- ~Confucious 2/4/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Green Mire Cuirass is a set of Green Yori armor that is great for characters of any class for use until well into their 20’s if they wish. It covers upper, and lower body. It is located in the Green Mire Grave not far from Shoushi. This is an adventure for characters of at least level 12 in a group, or level 18+ solo. From Shoushi head to the Lifestone at 25.7 S 74.8 E. There is also a house here that is safe to rest in, if you have been injured by the area’s nasties. From here head to the dungeon location at 27.8 S 71.7 E about a 3 minute real time run. The portal is surrounded by several pillars of stone. Inside you will find your self in a large room with 4 exits, and 4 surface portals. Through 1 exit you can get to the Green Mire Yari (see that quest) from another you can get to the Green Mire Cuirass. ****** WARNING****** The next section contains SPOILERS do not read this if you want to discover the dungeon on your own. Ok, you have been warned. For the Cuirass head to the West exit. Stick to the wall on your left until you come to an opening to your right with stairs down. The 2nd opening I think. Go down. When you get to the 4-way intersection go left to the end of the hall. There will be a door here to be picked. Not too hard. As you descend the stairs you will encounter several different Mosswarts. Barkers, Feeders, and Mudlurks. At the bottom the hall will turn left. There is a large room here. At the far end is a chest, with some minor magical traps on it. This is where the Cuirass pops. The chest is pickable, but for those of you, who can not pick, the Mosswart Chief drops the key to the chest. In either corner of the room pops Mosswart Shamans. They can cast some nasty spells, and for the lower level adventurer this can be deadly. Also, there is a stone arch. This is where a Ghost Wisp pops. The cycle is about 30 min. All monster, except the Wisp will pop 2X before the next chest pop. When you see the Wisp pop, that is the sign that the Cuirass has popped. Vylarn Monarch of the Elite Brotherhood Harvestgain. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vylarn 5/10/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The place is soooooooo crowded.  Forget the Curias, just pick up all the loot everyone else isn't intersted in.  I make from 15-30k a run. &lt;I&gt;	-- Bleys Icefalcon 5/23/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;when u get to the intersection it is right not left &lt;I&gt;	-- lighting strike 9/23/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The correct directions for the Green Mire Cuirass: From the entrance, head west.  Take first left. Take first right. at the crossroads take a right, not a left.  Follow to a locked door and pick it. Follow beyond the dorr to the room with the chest. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Key for the West wing door is located in the north wing on a barker moswart. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have also found a red key that says it goes to 'a prison door in the Green Mire Grave'. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you dont have lock pick here is what you do.  From the entrance, head North into the dead end section, kill the barker mosswart, grab his key.  Go back to entrance area, head East until you reach an area with a locked door going upstairs.  Use the key you just got off the barker and head on in.  This area leads further upstairs until you reach the grave area, which is the highest point of the dungeon.  You can get the prison cell key off the low level mosswart (its redish).  Return to the entrance area then head South.  The southern area is small, 2 low lev mosswarts and a few drudges.  In the drudge area, you get the prison cell chest key off the big drudge.  After heading back to the entrance, head West. Take a left on the first fork in the hall, then make an immediate right heading downwards. At the 4 way crossroad, make left, kill the 2 mosswarts and use the red key to open up the prison cell.  Use the key you got off the drudge to open the chest.  Inside the chest is a key that opens the BIG door that leads downstairs and all of its medium level baddies.  Once downstairs, you must kill the Chief mosswart in order to get the key that opens the chest which gives you the Green Mire armor. To open the chest in the upstairs section (East from entrance) you need to kill a mosswart in the West/Upstairs section.  Cant miss him, he has a barker and shamen to keep him company. NOTE: This place can often be camped by high level monarchs obtaining easy armor for their vassels.  &lt;I&gt;	-- prok 1/3/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NOTE:This dungeon is allmost allways camped by everyone all of the time.Expect to wait for many hours for the armor during peak hours.and you can forget about getting the yari.if you come at midnight there might not be anyone around but you better be able to solo everything from the weakest mosswarts all the way up to the mosswart cheif and the wisp that guards the chest with the armor.unless your level 20 or 30+ then your screwed no matter what. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sega Slayer 3/24/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;heh...now everyhting I said in my last post is innaccurate.

    <description>Drops out at 84.2S, 34.4W. Before you go in to portal, Be prepared to fight a 14th level Gold Phyntos Wasp.  60 health and 70 mana.  there are 2 of them.&lt;BR&gt;bull crap i been here a hundred times and i never seen a gold wasp,  mire wasp yes but not gold,  and i would be mroe affraid of the lich lords and ash""s that spawn a little to close to the portal exit &lt;I&gt;	-- Shags 10/1/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beenhere, the Gold Wasps killed me before the ashes did. &lt;I&gt;	-- Eaglewerks 10/4/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Last time I visited was greeted by a lovely Mountain Rat.  Ever since the dires patch the smart thing to do is come out running, you go north enough and you""ll find the exit portal, camp there unless you have 20+ people who aren""t childsplay to a Ravener (lvl 19+). &lt;I&gt;	-- Manxer 10/17/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just used this portal today, nothing around upon exit but the lifestone was surrounded by raveners and stalkers &lt;I&gt;	-- Laciel 1/3/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Damm it ppl, the spawns are random, ive had all sorts greeting me out of the portal, the best thing to do is just run. Errrrr maybe not did that straight into Panumbs the once best get ur bearings. &lt;I&gt;	-- Crabus 7/20/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ha guys... you all joking. i just went through it and got killed by a nice umbris shadow. thats not what i expected ;) &lt;I&gt;	-- Nanies al-Fylin 12/3/2000 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Major drop really far down in the sewers with a life stone at the bottom. &lt;I&gt;	-- Atal 9/15/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After the ~75 point drop ther are life stones and a portal to Shoushi and the surface &lt;I&gt;	-- RB 9/16/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also a portal to Heb there. &lt;I&gt;	-- Al 9/20/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Surface portal used to take you to Accursed halls. Have not checked lately.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Honest John 2/17/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After the 60-70 point health drop, you fall into a very large area built like an underground fortress, with 3 lifestones and several surface portals including one to Shoushi. No monsters down here but looks like there was supposed to be, probably Golems judging from the height of the landings and the way the lifestones are spread around(not to mention the fake Golem piles behind the closed doors). One room that spawns a single dagger- nothing more. Obviously an unfinished dungeon. Good for fast travel to Shoushi. &lt;I&gt;	-- HothRebel 2/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;there is some monsters some black/grey rats,blue wasps,zombies but still after the larger fall there is no more monsters 3 portals 1-surface which is next to hebian-to 2-hebian-to?? an soushi...still think the run there is easier..  &lt;I&gt;	-- Alkitron 3/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you can find your way down, there is a locked room with a bunch of dillos in it...never went all the way through though cuz health was too low. &lt;I&gt;	-- yi 7/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Have been through the whole dungeon now, first level is a few wasps and grey/white/black rats,second level more black rats,third level - spiney dillos,fourth level - spikey dillos ,2 zombies and a lich, to get to the zombies and lich + getting down to the lowest level you need lockpick. At the bottom - 3 lifestones and 3 portals, 1 portal exits just s of heb, 1 std heb portal and one to Shoushi --- Ana-Linh Goh &lt;I&gt;	-- Ana-Linh Goh 10/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;Lockpick is reqired to get to any useful areas of this dungeon. Lifestones and portals to Hebian-To, Surface and Shoushi are at the bottom. This dungeon also has several Spiny Armoredillos on the 2nd level, 2 jumps down and behind a locked door. They drop Small Armoredillo Hides, which are housing and collection quest items. At the end of the Armoredillo area of the dungeon, there are 2 Spikey Armoredillos, which drop the regular Armoredillo Hide. This is also a housing and collection quest item. The respawn timer is around 10 minutes however, good to camp if you are desperate. &lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 9/13/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Ive seen banderlings (young, scouts, guards, ravers, captains), skeletons, skeleton warriors, mite sentries (i hate those mofos), and a couple of black rats and drudges (prowlers, slinkers, the other white guys). lots of jewelry, plenty of loot as weapons, healing kits. the best place is, due to population density, all right turns. at least for loot, as its not too populated. &lt;I&gt;	-- Liao Allard 5/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;Stop #9 in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 11/14/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Gnawer and Carrion Shreths when you walk in, and drudges throughout.  One Hunter Shreth at the end where you can get a decent shield. &lt;I&gt;	-- Maxxx 9/18/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also a drudge robber about halfway through with decent treasure. &lt;I&gt;	-- Bubb 12/19/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place has been handing out more magical gems lately, but it's usually camped by too many people. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kaizen Sie Koe 12/26/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you are level 8, almost any class, you can solo this place. As a warrior at 10th i could run the whole think in about 30 min. and take about 2.5k of loot out. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vylarn 12/29/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I can't get past that darned locked door. Is there a key? Or do I need lockpick... &lt;I&gt;	-- Alex Faysun 4/30/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;High camping spot.&lt;/B&gt; An intricate sewer system with drudges and shreths. A very intresting set of interior rooms behind a locked door (&lt;i&gt;need lockpicking&lt;/i&gt;). One hunter shreth and a surface portal at end. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zarkon 5/18/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The final room has an opening to the exit portal.  Run there in the arch and the three prowlers can't flank you.  Spawn is O.K., so you can build up some EXP pretty quick - good for 4-7th leveling quick.  STAY IN ARCH - or you will be flanked... &lt;I&gt;	-- Bleys Icefalcon 5/23/2000</description>

It has been destroyed by one of the drilling shadow spires. &lt;I&gt;	-- Lars Larsson 10/17/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ooops, portal is still there.

    <description>There is quite a few liches here, at a decent spawn rate. One right behind you when you enter, but he is down a ramp and usually armed with a long range weapon, so he doesn't get to attack you immediately, giving you time to prepare. From here, Right is to more liches and left is to Banderling Guards (and lots of 'em). And the one 27th Goldenback Tusker is now two 27th Goldenback Tuskers, but don't let them stop you from getting the decent XP from this dungeon, they can't reach you from their ""pit."" &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 8/30/2000 &lt;/I&gt;Stop #8 in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 11/14/2003&lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>This Fort has changed considerably as it is now the final dungeon in the Elysas Favor quest. Expect a large number of level 23 Hollow Minions in the courtyard. Below are the quest details: Note: It appears you can start the quest at Yaraq or Shoushi or Holtburg. Use the Witshire’s Key, gotten by doing all previous steps of the quest, to open the door to the building in the center of the courtyard. Once inside open the trap door under the stairs to enter the dungeon.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fort Witshire dungeon is very maze like. Once inside make your way to a large room and take the north passage. From there continue going down and north until you reach the final room. From there kill a Hollow Minion named Dranith Menacet who spawns in the northeast corner of the room. He will drop Menacet’s Orders. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Take Menacet’s Orders back to Sir Tenshin at 32.8s 73.3e. As a reward for your bravery for the kingdom you receive 2 Sturdy Iron Keys and Elysa’s Favor. Elysa’s Favor is a ring and has 2 spells. The first is Life Giver that adds 15 Health. The second is a random stackable Minor Spell. Our 3 rings had Minor Endurance (+5 Endurance), Minor Focus (+5 Focus), Minor Strength (+5 Strength), and Minor Armor (+20 Armor). The final orders can be tuned in to any of the 3 senior guards.

&lt;br&gt;The following information is out of date and is included for historical reasons.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;A deserted fort in between Cragstone and Glenden Wood.  Lots of monsters and a life stone.&lt;BR&gt;Good Hunting. Druges, Hunters, Brown Arms &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 9/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a great place for Mages and Archers. The lifestone close by really helps out. This place is starting to get heavily camped at times. Anywhere from 5-10 players present at any given time. Wizards and Archers blasting away from the castle towers rule the day here. Treasure could be better but exps are good. &lt;I&gt;	-- Maglight 12/28/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The portal is in the southwest tower of Fort Witshire.&lt;BR&gt;Green Wasps, Skeletons and Sekelton Captains.  Good for experience, if you dont have a lockpick dont bother...  Nothing great for treasure. &lt;I&gt;	-- Moe-Hone 11/12/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Above notes still valid. Green Wasps and Grey Rats on first floor.  Skeletons and Skeleton Warriors on the second floor. Skeletons, Warriors, and Captains on the third floor. Best thing about this dungeon is that most beasts are behind gates or doors, allowing time to heal between fights. Very dark in places. Need lockpick skill.  Treasure still nothing great, but good exp for levels 10 and up. &lt;I&gt;	-- Minas Tirith 2/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Black Rats now, no Grey ones. Only one Skeleton Captain, who is at the lowest level. Bring your missile defense! While half of the skels keep you busy in melee, the other half shoots at you! Some nice wands as loot. Dungeon no problem for a lvl 15 solo meleer. &lt;I&gt;	-- Mobilat 8/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now the final stop in the Elesyas Favor quest. Cant be entered from ground level (unless you are a really good jumper) -- the front gate is barracaded. A copy of Whitshires key needed to get into the second part of the dungeon. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 12/17/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Wait till the town spawns with many of them for a chance at a magic axe. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khrome-Khoran 9/18/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This (now empty) to town was once called Suntik.

And dont even bother going in the indergroud city &lt;I&gt;	-- Yanto 12/4/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=#FF0000&gt;&lt;B&gt;Have you been INSIDE the underground city?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Plenty of Mosswart shamans, and a chieftan with nice loot.

    <description>Dungeon full of icky nasties in the middle of the crater.&lt;BR&gt;Granite Golems right when you enter...all the way up to magma golems further in... &lt;I&gt;	-- Koban Cho 9/20/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is were the coveted Black wand all the mages want is located &lt;I&gt;	-- Asalan 10/1/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A very hevily camped area with 3 treasure chest that are currently broke &amp; do not spawn much. But are heavily gaurded byt 7 level 103 Magma golems. Campers are here mainly to level as each magma golem will give 9000 exp. In this cave are Magma's, iron, obsidian, granite &amp; copper golems 2 knath's also. lol the entered by slot wont fit my whole name so  Im putting it herre :) Habib the terrible &lt;I&gt; 11/30/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great place for life mages to lvl.  If possible, come here at lvl 15 (the lvl limit).  There are so many cheap spots among the granites, and once you can take them out easily, the magmas wait below.  In the entrance room, 3 granites spawn across from you, to left and right will be 2 portals.  Get up next to the wall between the portal and the granites, a bit closer to the portal, and use life magic to kill all granies without them being able to get to you.  Go down into a room with a chandelier.  Take the center hallway from there.  There you see a little V shape split.  Lure guys here, run on opp side of V from them, and more easy XP.  Also, granites cant run underneath the chandelier if you lure them up there.  Copper golems can however.  Next take a right.  There will be 1 granite right there, lure him out, and kill him.  Now you can go in, turn left, and get next to the wall.  From there you can hit the granite who, if done right, is stuck against the corner.  He can still get you with magic though.  The other you can lure behind a big rock thats aroudn the corner.  If you would have taken a left up higher, you end up going towards the magmas, and after you kill the first4 granies, there is another wall u can use to hide behind. For magmas, when you jump down, run forward a small bit, and turn right towards a portal.  Go into the corner near the magma there, easy harming and draining. Go back out to main hallway and go as you were going.  A bit ahead, near a lot of magmas, there is a ramp to your right, sit on the ramp for more easy XP. &lt;I&gt;	-- Flamelord 1/5/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Life magic sucks :-] &lt;I&gt;	-- Nightwolf 2/1/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I agree withthe Above statement. Hopefully a said by the designers, Magma's will start learning the spells cast on them  &lt;I&gt;	-- Keric Horde 3/2/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How in the hell do you get inside the rim of the crater by running? I've been to the dungeon via portal before.(player summoned) &lt;I&gt;	-- Juliet Dominici 3/9/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Come here if you wish to obtain an Atlan weapon.  There are a total of 8 chances per spawn, if you manage to kill the 4 coppers, 3 irons, and the obsidian and leave nothing behind for anybody else.  The mote spawn here ranges from poor to excellent.  Don't bother with granites if you only want motes, but sometimes they just get.  Nice place to power level and work on a quest at the same time. &lt;I&gt;	-- Xcalibur 3/27/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cool place for Mages who like to power-level by draining.  Virtually solely populated by the said Life Mages with only the occasional warrior or archer to be seen.  Creatures have been described above but the danger wasn't really emphasised :)  The very bottom is huge and spawns lots of Magmas.  Good fun draining them if that's what you like, but at the same time you're slowly taking damage from the heat down there!  And in response to a previous poster, the magmas now know their life spells :)  - they now drain you :).  Also home to Flares (lvl 12?), Flammas (lvl 43?) and Infernos (lvl 121).  Flares and Flammas are no problem to 25+ Mages, the Infernos are a different matter :).  Crap loot except for the occasional black rock from the magmas, black stone from the obsidian above or the even more occasional spawning mote from everything bar the Granites. A previous poster mentioned dropping down to the Magmas at level 15; well unless you've got someone with you who can dump a yield on them (at least IV) I wouldn't bother... my life is 240 and I still get resist, resist, resist :) If you want to practice on the Fire Elementals (Flare/Flamma/Inferno) before you go down then look no further than the Crater Lake :), just get ready to run from the Inferno, he hurts. &lt;I&gt;	-- Laz al-Farah 4/27/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sturdy iron key opens chest at bottom &lt;I&gt;	-- Shoto Fle-Alch 5/7/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can access the crater via a passage on the rim on its southwest side.  The passage is guarded by one (or two) groups of a Flamma and two Flares and is visibly marked by tall columns on both the entrance and exit sides.  Trying to jump in elsewhere can get you killed (even with 170 health!!). &lt;I&gt;	-- Tell of William 7/6/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They changed the bottom of this place in the July 2000 patch.  No uber chests down there now; the chests remain open, they don't even need picking.  The spawn of Magmas in the very bottom has been reduced considerably.  Where this was once an open area with a large lava pit in it, it is now populated with lots of small hut type structures which could be forges.  Next to one of the forges is a set of Pyreal Forge Bellows.  These are no drop, but I have no idea as to their use. &lt;I&gt;	-- Laz al-Farah 7/13/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don't know if this is just pure luck or what but I went here before June patch 2001 and got 1 SIK for about every 100 magma golems I killed. But now I get one for every 10-20! :) Now I can get some level 6 scrolls, thanks turbine.

    <description>This dungeon has at least two exits.  The one closest to the entrance takes you back to the start, but if you run straight through, using the center passages, you get to the exit surface portal that drops out at  in the middle of the Crater.&lt;BR&gt;Loaded with Zefirs which blast and drain you  (not recommended for lower level chars) &lt;I&gt;	-- Rodan 8/24/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Zephirs everywhere plus at least two dark wisps wandering about inside. When it comes to the Zephirs think about that scene in Terminator II where the kid says The police are here Mom asks How many Kid says Uh, all of em I think. Well, that describes this place and Zephirs. &lt;I&gt;	-- Wyldstar 9/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4 Dark Wisps Spawn throughout whole dungeon, 1 at the beginning and 3 more in between.  Great for getting wisp hearts to get Essence Flicker Orb. &lt;I&gt;	-- Darks Lord 1/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Portal is a half-click further north, underground. &lt;I&gt;	-- Immacolata 5/6/2001&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>In the middle of the crater is this village with a couple of merchants, a lifestone, a number of portals.  (Hilltop, Sho Roadside, and Crater Pathway)&lt;BR&gt;Any one know what lvls are good here, and how to get here?? &lt;I&gt;	-- Not telling! 1/2/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Way up and into the Crater at 64.8N, 9.5E &lt;I&gt;	-- Sol Noir 1/21/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here is where you´ll find Silencia, from whom you buy the glyph to merge with the Ingot to get the Atlan weapon (the glyph costs 9,500 pyreals). Before putting the glyph onto the ingot, make sure your attack skill is at least 250 to get a peerless (i even got a superior with 270). :-( &lt;I&gt;	-- Io Hell 7/11/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh, most likely you will find high level enchanters here who´ll buff your attack skill. Many of them are cool and won´t charge you for that, while other will ask for a C note. Waiting a little bit, you´ll get your buffs for free. &lt;I&gt;	-- Io Hell 7/11/2000 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Watch it, Olthoi Workers. &lt;I&gt;	-- Lumino! 9/15/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forget the workers, watch out for the Soldiers and the Noble &lt;I&gt;	-- One who knows 9/23/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 15+ &lt;I&gt;	-- Polecat 11/18/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This must be one of the easiest high level dungeons to locate, really close to the Mountain Shortcut portal in Arwic.  You portal into a large room which doesnt naturally spawn any of the giant insects&lt;br&gt; however if someone has been chased out of the dungeon (and alot are) there could be many of the nasty beasties waiting for you.  Ive ran out of there with upto 7 of the things crying to have my body for lunch :) A network of passageways lead downwards, these passages contain nymphs (dont be deceived by their Lvl - they hit very hard), workers and soldiers.  At the very bottom is a Noble. Usually the whole dungeon is very crowded, the noble is always camped. In there youll probably see some poor warrior tanking away with the Olthoi whilst a load of Archers do their thing - I gotta admit to being one. Exit portal is in room off large room where you portal in.  No exit from the bottom which means trying to get past all the olthoi again. I believe they spawn some of the best loot in the game, cant confirm this as I only went there for the xp and didnt hang around long enough to loot any kills. &lt;I&gt;	-- Laz al-Farah 3/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You dont have to watch out for the soldiers and noble. All are dead within 30 seconds of spawning. for the short bit i was there the noble spawned some nice stuff. &lt;I&gt;	-- Theneler ( TD ) 6/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance/exit is hot, covered by local Mountain Shortcut fauna. Dungeon is medium small, and spawn rate is slow, about eight minutes, so the hero carrying capacity is low.  Corridors are windy enough that wall working is easy here.  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;can you say camped? This place is camped if theres one guy here. and Doc why do all your post revolve around wall working? Dont tell me your one of those wussy life mages! I always thought better of you until this wall working stuff started. &lt;I&gt; -- Sega Slayer 12/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jun 03 update: Olthoi spawn updated a bit, and a whole new section added behind a portal at the bottom. New section is a large, honeycomb layout spawning Soldiers and Nobles at a medium spawn rate.  The hero carrying capacity has been much increased.  There is no exit near entrance in the new section. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 6/20/2003 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Further update: This place is now huge.  Evis and Guards found as well, and yet another new section -- Catacombs of Opposition -- behind the new section. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 6/21/2003 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Back of the Catacombs of Opposition has the Olthoi Hunters Camp, and some Swarm Guardians beyond them -- a rough place.  You can also get to the Catacombs from Black Death Catacombs. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 8/24/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The top looked easy, 3rd level monsters.&lt;BR&gt;newbie dungeon, home of a mysterious key &lt;I&gt; 9/23/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Top level is all red wasps (1-2 at a time) and gnawer shreths (usually 1).  Many behind doors.  On 2nd level are white rats and 1 undead.  Door is opened by going to far left corner (from door).  Chest was empty for me. Also 1 locked door on 2nd level w/2 rats... no idea what else is in there. &lt;I&gt;	-- Naamor 9/29/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Found the odd key on a white rat on the second level. &lt;I&gt;	-- Nether 10/10/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont tackle the undead unless you are at least level 4 and at full stregnth! &lt;I&gt;	-- Talus 11/17/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This Dungeon is level 1-6. &lt;I&gt;	-- Morgoth 12/5/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Mysterious Key / odd key mentioned is needed for the Quest for the Sword of light - see Halls of lost light - 76.7S, 74.8W &lt;I&gt;	-- Flibble 6/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can be tough to reach if you are within the level restrictions for entering. Land around is full of Banderlings, Reedsharks and Broken Fragments. Best route is to follow the line of standing stones that begin just north of the Rithwic Bridge, go cautiously and you shouldonly find drudges and red wasps in your path.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Mishiko 3/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt; This place has gotten tougher, now has Mire wasps, Hunter Shreth, and Desert Rats. The upper level is basically a large loop with rooms branching off, at the far side of the loop from the entrance is a ramp down to level 2 where the rats and the key are. &lt;I&gt;-- Halcyon 9/11/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is the location of Yi Yo-Jin, the leather crafter originally responsible for the hoary mattekar robes and who now can convert an older mattekar coat to a wooly mattekar coat. &lt;I&gt;	-- Servant-san 12/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The new furry mattekar coat looks nice, but remember that the conversion raises the coats value to 4k. So you will lose it a lot more. &lt;I&gt;	-- Keef the Thief 12/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Archmage here now sells ALL scarabs including the new Platinum scarab (72,000p for one).

    <description>This is a dead town surrounded by monsters.  Very cool for the atmosphere.  In it is the access portal to the Collier Mine.  Lots of Banderlings.&lt;BR&gt;Discovered this town as I was just going for a run, no named town because it is a Banderling town. Made up of about 8 building. located inside one of the buildings is the entrance to the Coiler mines. Have yet to make it iside this building. Town is full of Banderling Guards, Scouts and Raiders.. maby even some bigger banderlings. -- &lt;I&gt;Shadir 1/2/00&lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;inside the mine are assorted critters - Skeletons, Banderlings, and the undead Baron Collier.  Portal out down with the Baron, fun quest to kill him &lt;I&gt;	-- ChurnDash 2/4/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you are looking for a non-stop Banderling shoot, this is the place.  If you have moved beyond Banderlings this place is just plain irritating.  Expect to find yourself standing on a pile of Banderling bodies, whether you like it or not. &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place got a lot more dangerous.  If you can handle the Banderlings the town itself is the same, but the hills around it are full of tuskers, large groups of mites, banderlings, and hunter shreths (all things that will chase you in packs if you fire on them).  Anyone below level 15 or so is going to have real problems alone.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Lars Larsson 10/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Baron of Collier drops a cool amulet that gives you +15 hp... &lt;I&gt;	-- Janx Spirit 10/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are about 30 banderlings in the town, all on a 5 min spawn. Watch out when hitting the drudges in town, the high level drudges protect the lower level drudges. Dont be suprised when you get swarmed by 10 banderlings and 4 drudge lurkers at once. The portal is in a house guarded by 4 banderling guards. You need a special key to open the door unless you can pick a 600 diff door.  &lt;I&gt; -- Homer the Wise 7/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now you can find everything from Banderling Guards to Banderling Enforcers here.  There are now every remotly high lv monster here. I have seen everything form Linch Lords, Shad Lts, Greviers (sp),Monouga, Giga Luggies, Tusker Slaves, Dire Matties...  I love this new spawn pattern (tip use the LS here or tie to the Portal) &lt;I&gt; -- Eclipsa 9/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>In the basements of one of the shops in the Ghost Town.&lt;BR&gt;Closest to 56.7/38.5 &lt;I&gt;	-- Kendall t Quick 9/16/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pretty crappy dungeon for its location in the middle of a monster inhabited town...only saw drudges and a young banderling on the first and second levels. Better stuff outside the dungeon. &lt;I&gt;	-- Nether 10/23/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also has undead miners,skels and zombies. Baron of Colier has a lightning long sword and guards four chests... havent opened them yet.. theres a Treasure Chest I couldnt pick with the help of a 46th level creat. enchanter &lt;I&gt;	-- Kaizen Sie Koe 12/26/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No point in going through this dungeon, as the only good thing down there is a chest constantly besieged by campers &lt;I&gt;	-- Balder of Staal 12/31/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You need a key to open chest.  I dont know where to get it. Someone muttered somthing about obsidian golems though :) ohh that narrows it down!!. Ill post if I find anything, the guy with me says it carries great armour... opps, more campers!! &lt;I&gt;	-- Kahni 1/15/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Someone also told me you need a key, but they mentioned the direlands. That makes it easy :( Way over camped for crappy stuff... &lt;I&gt;	-- Orko 2/2/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;everything you get out of the chests has too high of requirements to use ive seen rank 5 swords that only cast lvl 2 spells and its waaaaaaaaay overcamped by low lvl players who have no clue of what they are even getting. bottom line if your gonna go there dont even bother with the chests you wont get one unless you wait like 3 hours   &lt;I&gt;	-- aln 2/4/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No level restrictions on the portal &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/15/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I found this place fun, kill a few Guards go and heal, repeat... Made 3,100p off the items that I found, As most of the Guards have a magic item on them. One house has a Raider in it, also there is a Raver running around. Note dont attack the Mite Scamp in one of the houses, as it will bring about 15-20 mites, not a fun thing to have happen. &lt;I&gt;	-- Nestor 3/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Made a trip here yesterday and found the camper chest gone...only 2 chests in the Barons room now&lt;br&gt; the one that has a difficulty of 999 (requires a special key) and an open one that loads moderate to low end items.  Nice, but barely (and maybe not even barely) worth the effort of getting to the bottom.  Got to find the key to that other chest... &lt;I&gt;	-- Dryke 3/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is ore in this mine (as well as in a wheelbarrel at the bottom of Arwic mines) needed to complete the Emious Staff quest.  Anybody know where it is?  Ive searched and searched and havent found it.  Also, anybody know where to get the key or keys that open the treasure chests?  There are two 999 chests (on in the Barons room and another nearby) and a 700 chest (upper floors).  The dungeon is rediculously easy for a high level player, but surprising when I went not another living soul (no pun intended) was there. &lt;I&gt;	-- Xcalibur 3/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I still recommend Arwic Mines for the iron ore.  This mine is too remote to be convenient. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 3/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;the mine are broken/empty, at least on sol, collier itself is still full of nasties 10/02/00 &lt;I&gt;	-- Shorou Kai 10/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ore in Arwic Mine was nerfed in the Sept 2000 update. As far as I know colier is only place to get iron ore now??? To find the wheel barrow get past the first door requireing barrons key(NOT pickable 1000?). Follow right wall (dont jump in pits) there are 2 undead guarding it. I found that ore spawned every 20-25 min but its on a 1-2 hours quest timer so if you want more than one bring a friend. The barrons key can be found on an undead(cant remember which type miner?)in the cell area its the cell door at end of hall. Which actualy isnt realy a cell its another hallway that curves to the left leading to more cells. He also drops the sratched key which is used in Life Giver Quest. Kill a Drudge(man is he ugly)inside a house on surface to get key to cell door(pickable). Kill a bander Raider in house across from the portal to get rusted key which opens entry door to mine(also pickable). &lt;I&gt;	-- Dark Man - Sol 10/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Is the quest broken or retired? I went down there, got all the keys, slew the Baron and used the treasure chest key to open the locked chest in his room. There was a mana stone and another item I cant remember. But no Coliers Lifegiver :-(((( I have done this quest before, but that is more than a month ago. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sis. Immacolata 2/4/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;its a pain to get to it run from holtber dont no wich way gatta run through buncha crud like goldenback crimsonback fale female tuskers drudge lurker level 50 :( few banderlings if u like hunting high level ursins like linvak esper maybe a dire or so shadows maybe some fragments and broken ones plese come prepared kill creatures in the ghost town till u have 2 diffrent keys then find clier mine portal find the firds key bye finding a room whith an undead on the wall an undead miner spawns thare he has 2 keys find some locked chests till one has a treashure key in it when u find a room whith a switch press it then run across then u gatta jump ..btw its not that hard of a jump. if u wanna to the quest agin u have to exit then enter then repete the prosses kill the baron and like 6-7 minerz:(( then use the treashure key on the chest to the right in the room whith the baron in it im not shure where the ore is but id like it if some one found it and put a message where it is... &lt;I&gt;	-- rabbithunter  4/10/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Barons Amulet will cast a unique spell giving you extra HP ! This is THE item to find... The key story is a bit difficult (two keys to find outside, others inside) but the reward is great ! &lt;I&gt; -- Rackel 8/28/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Barons Amulet of Life Giving -- Difficulty 45, 230 Max Mana.  As of 8/2001 on LC, Trade Value = 5 SI Keys. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Barons amulet is definately working as at 02 Sept 2001, completed sucessfully. &lt;I&gt; -- Hol 9/4/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>In the lower antechamber of the castle.&lt;BR&gt;This place has just about every monster you would want behind bars. Lots of liches, a tusker and even a few gold wasps. &lt;I&gt;	-- Manxer 9/28/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Big place! Not that a good portion of the monsters are NOT behind bars, so be careful. Lots of liches. &lt;I&gt;	-- Nether 10/27/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nice Architecture on actual surface compund, although not a single creature there. Would make a fantastic spawn spot--I am suprised it is not used as one currently-reminds me a good deathmatch map :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Kira Argounova 12/4/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Update: Was here today and most of what was behind bars were undead and banderling ravers...the two gold wasps are nice but they spawn slowly as do the two liches at the bottom...lockpicking comes in handy as the wasps are behind a locked door and there were many other locked doors and chests as well...keys to the cells are easy to get if you want to loot as well as kill :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Khrome-Khoran 5/7/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungoen is for the Neydisa Haubruck quest.First though you have to go to Neydisa Castle and buy some Nelvaine's Olde Ispar Stout, after that ALLLL the way back to the bandit castle and give the ale to Mac Dugl's lieutenent and he gives you a key. Inside its explained by notes above but the locked door to the wasps is where you use the key that the lieutenent gives you. Kill the wasps take the alcy bag and the note. The note you take back to Neydisa Castle and give it to Lady Tallial and she gives you the hauberk(Al 100 with somewhat decent resistances)the alchy bag you give to the alchemist next to the bandit castle prison portal for 40 frost arrows. &lt;I&gt; 6/4/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, there is a locked chest just outside the gold wasp room, which i believe has the bandit shield in it (i forget the stats, but i think its only AL 70 or so).  Any confirmation? &lt;I&gt;	-- redmoskito 6/14/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just to note, like MANY other places, this is a BAD place for mages to go to....it's probably easier just to target the bag and notepad grab and run to the portal before the gold wasps do much dmg.  Making more than one trip would also probably be a good idea.  Take a buddy with you..... &lt;I&gt;	-- kwailo  7/14/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BAD place for Mages? This is a Wonderful Place for Life Mages, most every thing is behind bars. You can't ask for a better Find as a Life Mage. I've been here since Level 1 and that was just a week ago. If you want a Good leveling place for starting Life Mages. This is a good place for it. -Bear the Archmage &lt;I&gt;	-- BearTheArchmage 9/7/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No point in going here first...go to 69.6n 17.6e first to get the Olde Ispar Stout &lt;I&gt;	-- matty 9/19/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;VERY GOOD PLACE FOR LIFE MAGES TO DRAIN! - I agree wholeheartedly Bear.. I spent a good amount of time here levelling up! :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Opti Silmara 9/29/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great place for low level mages and newbies to learn the art of life magic (if they can find someone to portal them into the dungeon). People are often killed when they go after the gold wasps. DON'T MESS WITH THIS WASPS AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT LEVEL 30+ (with some good magic protects) OR IF YOU CAN'T DRAIN THEM. They don't look very dangerous but they are very nasty, fast and unforgiving. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kara Gandharvi 12/20/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Next to the exit portal at the end of the dugeon (near where the Gold Wasps are) is a locked chest. Inside the chest is the BANDIT SHIELD (AL 60, Flame Protection Other II). The chest has a resistance of 500. I never no clue if there is a key for it, or where it might be located. I was able to pick it with Lockpick of 296 and Weaken Lock IV. &lt;I&gt;	-- Qryax 1/10/2001 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Good log-out site.&lt;BR&gt;This tower isnt empty any more, has an Ivory Crafter within it now. &lt;I&gt; 12/18/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yeah, and her pet blue phyntos wasps. Or what ever they are. Theres a locked chest in here and a lever. The door cannot be opened by conventional means. To do that you must run through the Stone Circle a few steps north of the Tower. &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata 5/2/2001&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>2+ Olthoi Workers (lvl 55) inside. Surface portal right next to the entrance. Didnt go any farther as I was alone.. :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 9/29/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is one of the new Interest Points on the Map. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 9/29/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It has been around for awhile...what is new are the nearby lifestones, one in the Northern Castle (a full-service town), and the other in Esper Caldera...you can walk down from the rim of the Caldera in one spot, or jump backward from many others...however if you dont portal out you must find the one spot to walk out at...(hint: 65.3N, 11.2E) &lt;I&gt;	-- Twisted Sword 10/3/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inside are many Olthoi, rangeing from Nymphs to Soldiers. The castle nearby is NOT full service. There is no armorer or jeweller. &lt;I&gt;	-- Soo Yung 1/1/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BUGGED - The dungeon attempts a complete reset when you are inside making it very difficult to manuever.  You would almost think LAG but its not.  Frame rate drops down to 2-4 frames per second - Which with all those olthoi, can get ugly real quick. &lt;I&gt;	-- Olthoi Food 1/6/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a medium-size Olthoi dungeon with nymphs, workers and soldiers.  It is early era design: the gen rate modest, the corridors twisty, it can be wall worked.  The exit is safe, the entrance guarded but easy to run into. The foyer doesnt gen, but monsters who have chased people into the foyer stay there. The dungeon is not too busy, and not too hazardous to reach, so its a good place to test out Olthoi tactics. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 7/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Northwestern town.  Lots of monsters in the way.&lt;BR&gt;Mostly a staging point for the Pit dungeon, south of there.   Some hunting near the town (Crude Monougas, Wood Golems, Mites and Banderlings).   Phyntos Menace dungeon is also near.  Vendors have a good selection from all the players selling loot. One-way gate to the Heartland (Between Glendon Woods and Cragstone) nearby. &lt;I&gt;	-- Saffron Dusk 10/3/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pretty good selection of mage goods..lockpicks peerless,suberb etc etc &lt;I&gt;	-- Alkitron 4/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Way to there is now crowded with Tuskers (up to Goldenback) and shadows (on Harvestgain) &lt;I&gt;	-- Jean Ranta 5/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Are there any portal to Stonehld &lt;I&gt;	-- Hanas-Mouringth 7/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can actually live in Stonehold, I have a friend who succeeded in getting mules there.  Because of the very long trip, by foot, very few people.  Tough creatures within sight of town.  I fought a Goldenback Tusker in the village square.  Shadows, Stalkers and Lurkers within easy walking distance.  Town merchants buy everything at reasonable prices, and Archmage sells full compliment of trade notes.  Level 20+ Hermits, this is your town.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Desparately in need of an overhaul, I doubt anyone ever goes here, its much too far from newbie areas. Are there any true newbies in this game anymore, for that matter? I havent met a sub-20 that didnt have a high-level char on some server in a loooong time. &lt;I&gt;-- Halcyon 9/12/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

The side are a little steep in places but naviagble. Hideing next to the stone head are 2-3 mud golems. Also in and around the crater are rust grommies and red wasps. Not a bad area for the level 5-8 player with a life stone a short distance away. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dei Ray 3/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sometimes 4 Mud Golems and trick getting in or out.

    <description>Really funky looking portal.  Levels 1-5&lt;BR&gt;Quest Dungeon - Level 1 - 7 &lt;I&gt;	-- WeeWillieWinkie 1/1/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;now level 1-9 &lt;I&gt;	-- Ragnarok II 4/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Appears to be broken--the quest is to take nectar to the Keep Master in Lytelthorpe, and he will give you a key to the rest of the dungeon. The nectar is behind the locked door, though. &lt;I&gt;	-- Ander the Quick 5/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No, Ander its not broken. I just went in there, and the nectar is in the same chest where its always been, not behind the locked door. If the chest is empty, you just gotta wait for it to respawn, like any other camped dungeon. :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Niten Kensei 6/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now level 1-20 home of the Town Stamp (at the beginning near the exit portal between the rocks). Nice newbie dungeon to level &amp; do a quest at the same time. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kara Gandharvi 1/8/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Very Popular town. Lotsa armor &amp; weapons in the shops--better than Holtburg IMHO. &lt;I&gt;	-- Iceon 9/17/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not sure about the armour and weapons part. Everytime I have been there, nothing good is in the shops execept for an occasional Ice Tachi &lt;I&gt;	-- Xoran II 2/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Components are at base price here, up to Silver scarabs and up to Moderate Mana Charges.  Long run from Holt, semilong run from Hilltop. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield Bond 8/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Halfway Portal from Holt -&gt; Gledon - at 36.7N on the Road Turn Due West the Portal is about 15 Seconds Run &lt;I&gt;	-- Reslk lvl30 8/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This might be the best place to call home in Dereth. Plenty of decent weapons and armor to buy. Archmage sell scarabs up to silver, and tapers are cheap at 28 pyreals. Lifestone in town (!), plus a lifestone at each outpost, east and west of town.Easy to powerlevel to level 5 in 30 minutes because the countryside is loaded with monsters. Create your character in Holtburg and run him to the portal at 36.7N, 29.1E. Many friendly people easy to get a portal opened to almost anywhere in Dereth. &lt;I&gt; -- Happy Spellmore 4/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hmm....with the June update moderate mana charges are now 2,550 pyreals amd tapers are 43 pyreals! This place has alreadt lost some population. Too bad. &lt;I&gt; -- Happy Spellmore 6/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Theyre big.  Theyre bad.  And theres a lot of them!  Good treasure if you can survive...&lt;BR&gt;One of the nastiest areas Ive seen. Surrounded by tons of skels of numerous types and sprinkled with dillos, golems, and various other baddies. Bring a small army with you as we did nothin but run for our lives. &lt;I&gt;	-- Cieran 12/25/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great place for 3 or 4 20+ guys.stuff around fort is not as bad as above poster makes it sound but makes it hard to run away if you have to. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sega Slayer 12/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Monsters in the are now Dolls, dune reavers, silt lurkers, and skeletons with the occasional dread mu-miyah. &lt;I&gt; -- Yellowbeard 6/8/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Monters in the fort are still Lugians, and its still a fun place to take down. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 2/28/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>What more can I say?&lt;BR&gt;One of two Lugian Outposts...there are generally only 4 Lugians at any one time in this very small dungeon. &lt;I&gt;	-- Min Donner 9/15/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Usually a shield that spawns every 5 mins there. &lt;I&gt;	-- Puncture 4/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    Lots of twisty tunnels...could be dangerous with lugians in a closed space.  Lithos and Laigos lugians right when you enter.  Not crowded...no one else was there! &lt;I&gt;	-- Zenaph 6/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Very uncamped due to the logn run from the nearest lifestone.  Nice hunting outside while the lugians respawn.  Everything from low drudges to lugians, coppers, matties.  The mountain fortress is also nearby if you run out of other stuff.  The entrance is safe, the exit is not. &lt;I&gt;	-- War Mongress 2/26/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Quiet town, few players, no portal storms. Has weapon/armorer, archmage, healer, jeweler, sage, grocer, tavern, leather crafter, ivory crafter and a stone collector. Mostly lvl 12-20 players due to lvl of most nearby monsters and dungeons. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khrome-Khoran 9/18/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My favorite town.   Really tranquil, sleepy place.  An excellent starting point for the Crypt of Ashen Tears, Sylsfear, the Halls of Helm, a trek to Stonehold and the Moss Caves (but why would you want to go in there?  Nothing!) &lt;I&gt;	-- Saffron Dusk 10/7/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wahts a portal storm?? &lt;I&gt;	-- Not telling you 1/2/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Starting town for unarmed weapon quest.. &lt;I&gt;	-- Silverion 3/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Starting point for many quests, including the Impious Staff.  Is part of the Frore quest as well. In the AC backstory, this is the capitol of the Gharundim people. &lt;I&gt;	-- Grim Fiddle 6/11/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My home town. Nice quiet town, with all your basic needs. Perfect for vacationing :D. Beautiful countryside, with some average to good hunting. And if that isnt enough, its got portal ties with Qalabar and Cragstone, which both eventually lead to Heiban-to. &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 8/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Place where you can buy almost all the spell componets, they have all the tapers, but missing the final 2 scarabs &lt;I&gt;	-- John the Strong 9/27/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A town, center for ghrun Dim &lt;I&gt; -- TKM 12/7/99&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also great for cooking and a rock collector, great place and good money compared to its naboring town Yaraq (see what I said about Yaraq) great hunting on the way there as well, watch out for Hunter Streth and Low lvl skeltons &lt;I&gt;	-- Cheiron Vale 1/2/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No one sells any spell components or tapers in this town any more. &lt;I&gt;	-- Killindil 3/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nice little town. There IS a mage shop here and it is one of the best Ive seen. Has some of the best prices for Mana charges! &lt;I&gt;	-- Gonj The Unjust 3/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fletcher in this town is good, too.  He sells blunt, AP and broadhead arrows. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 4/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alas, the fletcher only sells Armor Piercing now. &lt;I&gt;	-- Truthsayer 6/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Has Alchemy Supplies and Lockpicks of all qualities.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Khaos 8/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tufa is no longer.  Now a giant crater destroyed by shadow spires.  3 Spires still loom above it.  Electricity randomly erupts from the ground.  A waterfull now runs through the center of the crater with a black fog that does dmg to you.  Also, the new Spider creatures spawn in the cratet, but only every 30+ minutes. &lt;I&gt;	-- T-Bird (HG) 9/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The pit spawns a group of shadows and children and a spider - kill the spider and you get the following message The Grievver collapses at Megachiropteras feet with a sickening wet sound! Moaning in pain the other shadow-spawn collapse. The steaming wreckage of Tufa is quiet, for the moment. when you examine the corpses of the shadows they are killed by misadventure  &lt;I&gt;	-- Megachiroptera 9/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tufa is back to being a full service town.  There are some side effects.  The merchants are scattered, and some (like the bowyer) have much reduced selections.  Second cheapest source of healing kits I know of (so far only Cragstone has cheaper kits).  The Tailor is decent, there is a trader with Peerless lockpicks and the mage still has a good selection of comps including the level 1-4 scarabs and all the tapers (38 pyreels each as of today).  Unfortunately the mage pays only 50% - Sell your magic stuff in Yaraq and get 100% instead.  Stone Collector and Ivory Crafter seem to be gone. Also the Shadow Spires have dispersed. &lt;I&gt;	-- Maglor Daefalas 11/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ya-Bint-Al-Hawa tells you, There are healing kits even more potent than the ones dropped mainly by Lugians.  The Zharalim have recently uncovered lore that enables them to treat these kits in order to make them more potent.  If you trade me a memnosyne fragment, I will reward you in turn, depending on the quality of the fragment. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sixfingers 3/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Warning!  Gates lock at dusk...&lt;BR&gt;Be prepared for 20+ Tumeroks just outside of town. &lt;I&gt;	-- Manxer 9/29/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;actually, gates remain locked round the clock. I camped for one full day/night cycle..they never opened or became unlocked. &lt;I&gt;	-- Grainger 11/16/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Get the gate key from a man in East Rithwic hiding under the stairs at the pub &lt;I&gt;	-- Weezl 11/16/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can also buy the key from the Weary Old Man in Eastham &lt;I&gt;	-- Ari 12/5/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inside the town you can get a parchment with directions to help you find Sir Joffres Party. There is also a tower guarded by Tumeroks due north of the town. I didnt go in though, as we had already lost two members of our party. Many Tumerok warriors. Recommend lvl 18+ fighters or 15+ mages &lt;I&gt;	-- Ten Miles High 1/4/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Smith buys weapons and armour at &gt;100%, Jeweller buys at good prices also.  Make a small fortune selling the junk youd normally not bother picking up. &lt;I&gt;	-- Ylyrra 5/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where is this parchment for Joffres party?  I cant seem to find it.  More details greatly appreciated. &lt;I&gt;	-- Davros 9/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you plan to stay in Dryreach for any period of time bring a lockpicker or several keys, as each key is only good for three uses and the loot around here is very heavy.  You will use your key up very quickly, and just because there is another player inside the city doesn not mean that he will open the doors for you.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>IMO dont bother going here. Beatuiful place, nothing that matters. Between it and Shoushi though, is a BEAUTIFUL mountain, shaped like a man from above.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Adren 9/18/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All basic stores here. Close to swamp ruin,full of mudlurks and barkers,couple shamans.  &lt;I&gt;	-- PizzaFiend 1/14/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The only reason to go to this smelly swamp town is to get blunt arrowheads, which come in handy for direlands hunting. &lt;I&gt; 1/19/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hear, hear, one of the worst laid out places on the map.  Bad news monsters in the trackless swamps north, and a lifestone thats halfway to enternity heading south. I left two corpses in those swamps just trying to get into town from the north. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/15/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A good reason to go here: it sells basic stock Yoroi armor for the lowest prices anywhere. For example, basic AL 80 Yoroi leggings, which cost 1788 in Mayoi and 2145 in the Hebian armorer sell here for 1645 (as of this date). Other Yoroi-type basic stock armor pieces are similarly low priced. So if you are like me and like checking out unknown areas in armor that is not a problem to lose (coming back with your good stuff once you know you can handle it), here is the place to get basic Yoroi stuff. Its also not a problem to get to...run NW from Shoushi on the road that passes the GMG. Not hard at all. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zimbalt 5/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  I liked Sawato, The swamp can be a pain but there is a life stone with a Mage to thee North as well as a Mosswart Tower that holds mudlurks, barkers, and a shaman.  If you head North through the swamp and into the mountains you can find another lifestone. In the mountains there is a mosswart Chief and many other good monsters. &lt;I&gt;	-- MojoRisen 5/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My opinion of Sawato has improved since my previous entry.  Lifestones are now close by both east and northwest, the mage shop has low prices, there is a trophy smith and a wing collector, I can use blunt arrowheads, and its close to the Sho Roadside exit point. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you want blunt arrowheads (and you do!), this is the place to get them. &lt;I&gt;	-- Keef the Thief 12/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If youre looking for plants with which to dye your armor red, the swamps to the west are a great place to find them. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sixfingers 12/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mage here now sells plat, pyreal, and gold scarabs. &lt;I&gt;	-- Xarion of MT 3/5/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Casino nearby, It should be a boom town soon. I prefer heb for a bse though but I think I may temporarily Move to Sawato. &lt;I&gt; -- Satsujinki 4/26/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also home to the Ogre Mask maker named Tsua Kagemata as of 7/7/01 give him a Virindi mask and hell give you an Ogre mask (AL 220 UA IV sho only UC 180) &lt;I&gt; -- Chryon 7/7/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Good lvl 3 to 10 area, the area just across the river is good hunting. Lots of drudges, mosswarts, and variety of shreaths. &lt;I&gt;	-- Asalan 9/19/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best prices on mana charges I have seen &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fair prices, but not the best. For moderate and small charges (what Hebian has), both Eastham and Glendon Woods have the best prices. Moderate in Heb (bungalow mage): 1995p. Moderate in GW and Eastham: 1650p. High and Great charges are available at all 3 of the master mages in Dereth, and work out to be the best cost-per-mana, if your items can hold 500 (high) or 1000 (great) mana a shot. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zimbalt 10/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tailor pays full value, for you shirt accumulators. &lt;I&gt;	-- Ognam 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Mage store carries peas, although they are cheaper in Mayoi. &lt;I&gt;	-- Tressia 2/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A great town with links to Qalabar and Cragstone.  Smack in the middle of Nanto and Shoushi.  Fully funcional town, has a Virindi Gem Collector.  Sell rate is 90%. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Home of the Incredible Blacksmith of Lag. Takes a while for the shopping window to come up, but the selection is incredible due to the nearby South Direlands Portal &lt;I&gt; -- Valis 9/26/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;the black smith has been fixed so its not so bad anymore &lt;I&gt; -- s 12/5/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Small, hard to get to, should be atleast 7th lvl to try, Drudges and Low lvl streth-Mongoas on the route from shoushi &lt;I&gt;	-- Cheiron Vale 1/2/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7th level my foot. Ive done it at 3rd level. You just need to stick to the road. If you can outrun a group of drudges you can get here easily. &lt;I&gt;	-- Mycroft999 1/4/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a portal from shoushi to Nanto then you can run south from nanto. I have made the trip as a lvl 1 mage and it is not that difficult. Another bonus about this place is the mage tower down the beach has very low prices and is very popular with mages.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Laitly Crestfie 2/13/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Excellent hunting from level 5-20, with great transitions from lowly Drudges to Grommies and Water Golems to Amploth Lugians to even Shadow Liutenants being sighted not give minutes from town.  Spectacular beachfront property, to boot. &lt;I&gt;	-- anony 6/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I would just like to note that the Prices at the mage shop are not low, bu actually rather high. For mana stones at least... &lt;I&gt;	-- Ganzor 6/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mage tower close to town has crappy prices, but the one farther down the beach south and east has decent (10% markup) prices, worth the extra 2 minute run &lt;I&gt;	-- Serafin 8/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bowyer sells Armor Piercing arrowheads.  Worth a trip if you have an alchemist/fletcher &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good hunting but good and crowded too. If you dont like to run into too many people while out adventuring, Mayoi is probably not the best choice of hunting spots try some of the Gharu towns out west which are virtually deserted. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hu Pong 11/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Tall towers with good views of the surrounding landscape. Supposedly good items to buy, though I havent looked myself, and with the many amount of people, good place to sell/trade things. An uncrowded corner has rat spawn in it. One warning, however. When I first entered, I found my computer freezing up big time. This is when I discovered the rat infested corner. This is also when I discovered that I could change my video settings to make my framerate faster. This is the only place Ive ever experienced such horrible framerate with those settings. &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 8/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This portal is restricted to levels 1-10. Wouldnt recommend a level 1 goes in alone since the drudges will gang up on you.&lt;BR&gt;Drudges ganging up on you? I went through what I think is the whole place, and did so for about 10 minutes, and I only found a robber, and a few sneakers on the upper levels. Either this place has a horrible respawn, or it is simply a boring dungeon &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 3/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ever since I found a Life amstery 2 orb and some good magic jewlery off the robber, I come back whenever Im in Rithwic. Also the room near robber spawns a tart apple (saved my ass a bunch of times) &lt;I&gt;	-- Ki 3/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Respawn rate is terrible. Drudges jump down at you when you enter, but take a long,long time to respawn &lt;I&gt;	-- Ragnarok II 4/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am sorry to say that in my opinion, this is one of the worst places I have ever been.  Although is is a lev 1-10 dungeon, I went in  as lev 4 with a lev 2 chr, we did it VERY quickly, got board and left.  Not worth the waste of time - there are far better places to get experiance in Rithwic - go to Rithwic Crypt for example. &lt;I&gt;	-- Flibble 6/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I wouldnt suggest a lvl 1 going in there, but its not really that tough.  I went in there at lvl 6 and soloed the tower, cleaning it out in under 10 minutes.  Talk about a disappointment. &lt;I&gt;	-- Himura of TD 11/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;BR&gt;hmm not sure which of these 3 stones is the one near the portal to shoushi, But for those who fight near shoushi (either the grotto or out in the woods with the banderlings) the Rithwic stone is accually closer to town then either Shoushi outpost stone! it drops you on the hill near the Grotto portal. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dryctor Ben Rei 1/16/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Its not this one. This LS is near the East Rithwic Outpost. The LS near the Shoushi portal is listed correctly here at 11.2N 59.4E &lt;I&gt;	-- Zimbalt Cac 3/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>It's actually just a little east of that location, from the shore of the lake. It's a building full of undead (undead spell casters too) and a tent. Didn't stop to admire the view as I was alone. Zombies and Undead galore&lt;BR&gt;This is also an Interest Point. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 10/3/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a collection of Gharundum buildings filled with about 30 fast-genning Undead and Zombies, and one slow-genning Liche.  No chests or other BDT (Big Dungeon Tresure). The surrounding monsters are plentiful and they will join in fighting if you stray too far from town center. In June patch the surrounding area is hosting some Auroch Fire cattle. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/15/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two level 20-ish Archers made a pilgrimage to the town.  We killed many undead and zombies and liches, but there were too many.  We were not able to loot the dead undead.  You will take bolts from every direction, you will be attacked by armoredillos and shreths and mites when you attempt to heal yourself in the trees.  The tent will not hide you.  We were forced to flee after we ran out of arrows.  We never did get close to clearing hte place.  If you come, come loaded, and ready for an epic battle.  This place is far out of the way.  You can spend an afternoon in non-stop combat, just you and the monsters.  We attempted to take the buildings, and engaged in some fabulous building to building street fighting.  But ultimately we were repulsed.  WARNING, the trip home may be even more dangerous than the town itself, especially if you blow your supply of arrows.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>This is where you go if you want to become an Advocate.  One Skeleton with a key that doesn't open anything. &lt;I&gt;	-- Grunzio 9/18/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Completing thsi quest doen NOT make you an advocate, its just one part of the process &lt;I&gt;	-- Honest John 10/3/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To become an Advocate, you must complete this quest, and then seek out an advocate in the game so they can promote you to Advocate status. &lt;I&gt;	-- Valadon Grimm 10/10/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Addendum - this dungeon is quite out of date by now. Anyone interested in being an Advocate should visit (link deleted by Geomancer 2-16-2005 - was long dead). &lt;I&gt;	-- Delantio 10/15/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   As of now you can pretty much put off going to the portal unless you're level 126... =) &lt;I&gt; 10/17/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was told that it was 126+ because of a bug, but I highly doubt it. &lt;I&gt;	-- Cerfance Justis 11/11/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not used by advocate programany longer. Nothing in there of note. Level 126 is to keep people out until the portal can be removed &lt;I&gt; 2/17/00 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually this dungeon is full of little rooms with no entrances or exits. A Sentinal took me there to check out some armor I had that had swear words in the inscrip. &lt;I&gt;	-- Bin Ibn Tabar 8/3/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place no longer exists. &lt;I&gt;	-- Grim Fiddle 3/16/2002 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ah what the heck, the AC-spedia Board of Derethian Curiosities have decided to let it remain for history's sake. &lt;I&gt;	-- Immacolata 3/20/2002 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Part of the 40+ Renegade Stone Clasp / Renegade Herbal Kit quest.  This dungeon is full of level 100 Tumeroks, Lugians and a few Murk Drudges.  At the bottom is Captain Waliknua, the tumerok leader here.  He holds several Strong Iron Keys that are used to unlock a chest at the bottom of Burun Cathedral (used to be old Sclavus Cathedral) just south of here. 1 week timer for key.&lt;I&gt; -- Taarna Blood SC&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Home of a SOLL key &lt;I&gt;	-- Ki Dung Sa Bong 10/8/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Watch out for Skel Wars just North of here. &lt;I&gt;	-- El Gareth 10/19/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Probably the toughest of the first 6 SoLL key quests. &lt;I&gt;	-- Bubba 12/19/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Worn Strange Key &lt;I&gt;	-- Wormtongue 2/23/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Outside this dungeon, I have seen everything from Innocent Dolls to Dread/Anciend Mu-Miyahs. Not good for low levels. If you stay on the side of the hill that faces town, you are ""relatively"" safe. However, I have seen Skeleton Warriors on that end of the plateau as well.

    <description>A small camp of Undead and Zombies.&lt;BR&gt;A short run from Heb To. Tough for low level chars. About six undead and a couple of zombies. Good exp for low level chars and some enchanted undergarments if youre lucky. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zulu Njomo 2/23/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Very nice xps for level 12-20.  Take a mixed group, as the zombies and undead spawn in groups and can overwhelm a lone player.  Lots of other stuff around the camp, reedsharks, blood shreths, bandies, etc.  Thanks to Ghungaden Ironwill for showing me this spot :) &lt;I&gt;	-- War Mongress 2/25/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is one of the new Fellowship quests.  Liazk Itzis Temple is the old shop of Fadsahil al-Tashbi the Master Archmage.  His portal gems still exit here making questing much easier.  Go inside and use the Odd Looking Vine to enter the dungeon.  You need Dragonsblood from any mage shop to appease the statue in the entry and open the door.  Inside there are 4 statues for 4 different level splits, with 100+ being the highest. The dungeon is just a series of long corridors and a few puzzles, there is no real boss monster. Prizes include Ancient Armored Bracers, and choice of Primary Attribute Fellowship spells, Bow, Staff, Dagger, and UA weapons&lt;I&gt;	-- Taarna Blood SC &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All pre 2004 information below is out of date and incorrect.  It is included for historical purposes. &lt;I&gt;	-- Taarna Blood SC &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;South west of Al-Arqas,Has all of the high level magic components, including pyreal scarab.&lt;BR&gt;Also sells the Gharundim master robe (50,000p+ each) &lt;I&gt;	-- Obsidian 1/24/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An excellent shop for PKs to stock up at...almost never anybody here!Also, prices are among the best! &lt;I&gt;	-- Krack 8/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not only are the prices good, the view is amazing. The building type thing that the mage is in is similar to the entrance to the HoLL with black smoke flowing out from the inside...theres a frost bolt spinning in one spot inside too. Great place to take a screenshot :&lt;br&gt;) Prices are the best u can get, and never laggy here. Run is relatively safe..just the occasional lowl level desert monsters. &lt;I&gt;	-- Nexic 11/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Scarab Prices: Platinum 44,000, Pyreal 1,100, Gold 550.  Great Mana Charges 6,050. All peas to boot.  &lt;I&gt;	-- prok 1/13/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Just North of Holtburg. Got some skeletons and a lich down on the lower levels... &lt;I&gt;	-- Garf 11/19/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   Exit near enterance. Early parts filled with little Drudge Skulkers galore. In the early rooms, fighting one will usually bring a lot of them if someone hasn't taken care of them. Takes a bit of exploring to find Sneakers or higher drudges and a bit more running to get to the area with Undead and such (there's a sign with a portal in the room before you enter the area with undead.) SoLL key here, look for it in one of the lower, smaller, white skinned creatures. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield3d 11/25/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To go in the lower level you must absolutely have a lockpick...  Beware for undead...  If you stay in the higher level there is only Drudges... It's good to gain xp for low level players...  &lt;I&gt;	-- Galadriel 12/22/99 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Worn Small Key &lt;I&gt;	-- Wormtongue 2/23/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon is now level 1 - 10. &lt;I&gt;	-- WuJen 2/27/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lich near bottom, spawns in room with locked coffin that has some pretty nice magic jewelry for a lvl1-10 dungeon.  Taking out the lich at  &lt; lvl10 requires a lot of teamwork and strategy and is very fun. &lt;I&gt;	-- Machina 3/5/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How does one enter the lower level without a lockpick? (Or anyone else who has one.) Is there a key somewhere? &lt;I&gt;	-- Tim 6/13/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To get through locked doors, have a friend with lockpick skill or create a new character with the skill and log that char behind the locked doors (there are many doors though). The 3rd level is great for level 4+ chars; tons of undead. Great for leveling and getting good loot for the dungeon's level restriction. Don't piss the lich off (on level 4). &lt;I&gt;	-- Lifestoner 10/8/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont even waste your time looking in the UNlocked sarcophagous-there is nothing there... If you beat the lich and end up in a room full of light, hug the walls, dont get in the middle of the room or you will meet an electrifing fate of a one who was scorched by a lightning trap... The sarcophagous in that room contain good jewelery as does the loot from the Lich-but watch out he is easilly boodered and not easily distacted from killing a character that ""pissed him off"" P.S. How come there are people of level 15&lt; there? I thought the dungeon was restricted to 1-10 lvl... &lt;I&gt;	-- Witold 3/2/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is no way to get to the bottom section without lockpick.  The SoLL key spawns on one of the white rats in th lower section.  There are level 15's here occasionally camping the undead, which can be fought and killed through the door.  If you leveled while in the dungeon, it does not kick you out. &lt;I&gt;	-- War Mongress 3/4/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drudge Slaves, Spikey Armoredillos, Swamp Rats, Sandy Armoredillo, Limestone Golem, Jade Gromines. Lower lockpicked levels unchanged. No level restrictions. SoLL key on the level 11 Swamp Rat. &lt;I&gt; -- Charles t Great 7/20/2003 &lt;/I&gt;Other than one SoLL Key, this dungeon also has 2 Spikey and one Sandy Armoredillo on a 5 minute spawn. A place to hunt hides if you are desperate. &lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 9/13/2004&lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Lack of Monsters&lt;BR&gt;Dont waste your time -- pathetic. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khrome-Khoran 9/19/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pathetic doesnt even describe it.   A great big place, filled with nothing.  5, maybe 6 Creeper Mosswarts, with only one that can attack you, the others being behind bars, with locked doors (no keys around).   A bunch of corridors, all doubling back to the same space, where you started.   True Boredom. &lt;I&gt;	-- Saffron Dusk 10/7/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still pitiful, no monsters. A waste of some decent architecture. &lt;I&gt;	-- Neilla 10/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was still pathetic around end of August 2000 when I was there &lt;I&gt;	-- Tadesha Xian 10/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place finally got a little upgrade! Check it out, youll have to search around some... &lt;I&gt;	-- Aliera 10/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Loot and experience are good for people in their teens.  Moderate amount of Mossies up to a Chief.  A few liches and zombies.  Lockpick is a must. How do you get down to all this fun stuff?  Finding it is the funnest part... &lt;I&gt;	-- Kinjou Dragoon 1/31/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No longer empty:&lt;br&gt; now its got higher level mossies (Idolators, Fanatics, Zealots, and Soul-Trappers) plus a very high level mossie chieftan whos hard to hit with melee skill of 300+.  Very fast spawn, as well.  At the bottom theres a portal called Moss Chamber, which leads into a room containing five mysterious Virindi NPCs. This is all part of the February quest. &lt;I&gt;	-- Constantine 2/15/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beware! On AC explorer only the first couple of posts relating to this dungeon appear. Beware! If you dont expect, or can handle, Mossie fanatics (L35) and zealots (L45), from the moment you enter,then you are doomed, as I learnt to my cost :-( &lt;I&gt;	-- Hagen II 2/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Is is the place you take your Virindi Essance and cloak (or shroud). Shroud and Essance gives you 5 diamond scarabs...cload and essance will give you one of 4 weapons...sword spear mace or axe...they have VERY good spells on them with low diff..but beware..you die and they are gone forever :P &lt;I&gt;	-- The Dead 2/19/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Lots of Banderlings.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; 10/2/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is an Interest Point. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 10/2/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No longer Banders but Tumeroks of lower lvl. 4 if i remember correctly. One chest. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kosugi 1/8/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Found 8 Tumeroks here, from lvl. 8 scouts to lvl. 20 warriors. &lt;I&gt;	-- Finn Djhala 2/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Over a dozen tumeroks now, with three priests, still one chest. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 3/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lots of Tuskers and Mites in the general area if you get tired of whacking Tumeroks. &lt;I&gt;	-- Warblade Prime 5/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chest still there, wasnt anything in it when I arrived. However, there were no Bandies, maybe they didnt spawn, but there were a whole bunch of esper and linvak ursuins around it. I love the way they die. &lt;I&gt;	-- Trebber II 3/13/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Very Hard, Surrounding it can contain Lich Lords, Granite Golems, Mid Level Drudges, and other nastys. I saw a few grievers... I brought my LvL 16 vassal and he died a few time obviously.. &lt;I&gt; -- DirX 10/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Locked, of course. Perhaps it holds the key to the tower a short distance towards Eastham? &lt;I&gt;	-- Immacolata 3/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Restricted to characters of Levels 1 - 6.&lt;BR&gt;1 of the 4 quest stones are here (Not the Stone of Compassion, or Humility though) &lt;I&gt;	-- Iban Sato 10/25/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Seems like this is now a drudge spawn party, no stones here. &lt;I&gt;	-- Merdryn 11/5/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Stone of Detachment IS here.  Just gotta go all the way to the bottom. &lt;I&gt;	-- Cindy 11/15/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is not a bad place to level up (to about 5th).  The entry level overlooks a pit filled with drudges -- fine hunting for archers and war mages. The bottom half is big, but not complex, and filled with low-level shreth. A fine time can be had by all kinds of newbie characters. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 4/11/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I went through it in a party of two and never saw the chests at the bottom with what were at the time HUGH SHERITH then my friend went in with three others and wooped its rear got the stone and some decient loot for the place but this was with a carecter with a heulm and chane mail armor when i had studded leather but its fun at any lvl that you can get in at if your in a grupe just never jump off into the big pit.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Leonon 9/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Find the Shoushi Town Stamp (for letter quest)right inside the entrance, next to the surface portal. Very convenient, no need to go all the way down. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sis. Immacolata 12/17/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lvl 1-20 only. Very nice place to level for low level warriors, archers and mages equally. But be careful when you enter, there are one or two druges waiting. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kara Gandharvi 12/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Been here 3 times, never seen a Shreth, just lots of drudges. &lt;I&gt;	-- Yuki of FF 1/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Shreths are located at the bottom, ranging from the Gnawers (which you can avoid since they are passiev), to Carrion, to one Blood at the end.  Bring armor, not a robe! :)  Jump midway through the dungeon, look for a small ledge, roughly 25 points. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne, LC 4/6/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Lugians, shadows, zefirs, shreths, banderlings, mosswarts, all within a 4-minute run of town. &lt;I&gt;	-- Chi Domkwai 3/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mage is expensive, sells only tiny mana charges and no tapers. You have to portal to Khayyaban to get tapers, and theyre expensive there. The other portal here is to Tou Tou, and the mage there doesnt sell tapers, either. &lt;I&gt;	-- Wa Chen 9/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can be a good place to shop for armor.  Jeweler gives fair prices.  Run between Nanto and Kin uis fairly safe and quick, one way of getting from Arwic-Al Jalima portal circle to the big portal circle (Yanshi portal in Nanto) &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great town for anyone under level 40.Drudges,mosswarts and banderlings(few nearby dungeons with these as well)spawn all around town for lower levels and the lugian citadel is nearby for the higher levels.good prices on stam elixirs and small mana stones. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sega Slayer 12/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now sells tapers and high end components (gold scarabs, pyreal scarabs and the new platium scarabs for example):&lt;br&gt; better selection than Arwic! &lt;I&gt;	-- Jan01Patch 1/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oops.. forgot to say mage shop, well you get the idea! &lt;I&gt;	-- Jan01Patch 1/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Close to Uziz, can be seen from the road. For characters of levels 10-20, havent been inside, but told is populated by skeletons and skeleton captains.&lt;BR&gt;Contains 1 Skeletal Lord and -lots- of Red rats. &lt;I&gt;	-- Maarek 9/15/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Skeletal Lord &amp; Red rat comment is incorrect. This place has mummies Lichs and a Lich Lord. There is also a Banderling Chief thats locked up and if you kill him you get a Copper Chainmail Shirt. &lt;I&gt;	-- Axel 09/17/99 9/17/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Portal to Samsur as well.  HeHe If you can find it. &lt;I&gt;	-- Lorthos 3/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is also one of the dungeons where you find a gem for the Crimison Stars quest. Upper Limit of Level 30 on the entrance portal. &lt;I&gt;	-- ReSpawn 4/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you enter you are in an L-shaped passage. Go around the corner and just past the surface portal is a four-way intersection of sorts. Jump down into the crossing passage and head north, till you come to another four-way. Go east into the large Temple room. Secret passage to Samsur portal is in the south wall, to the right of the altar.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Adric the Red 8/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the bottom, there is a LL and a Tortured Soul.  The TS has a liche skull on it that can be turned into a key to open the Mines of Despair if you give it to a hermit in the mountains NE of Kara, just outide the Undead Town and Mines of Despair.  Another room at the bottom contains a Greater Mummy surrounded by lessers that will drop the Ruby Mahwen which is NO drop and part of the construction of the Silfi of Crimson Stars.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Ryth-al-Rothgar 10/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 30 cap removed in 11/14/200 patch. &lt;I&gt;	-- Adric the Red 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Important Note! This will get you the Golden Key for the Focusing Stone [Mines of Despair] Quest, but you wont get the second key! See the Soul Fearing Quest writeup in order to get the correct skull. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>A complete starter town, with every merchant possible, and some good hunting up the western mountains (Level 15+). &lt;I&gt;	-- Saffron Dusk 10/7/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Newbie central and also a place to find scammers. I have found several people here looking for patrons. They take what they can and drop the gear onto their main character. Patrons beware! Also some very stupid thieves who will try to get you to hit the V key on the keyboard by promising that it will increase the value, armor level, etc of the item. Newbies beware! &lt;I&gt;	-- Morheru 4/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Newbie central, for sure. If the Yanshi left-side smith is the place to sell all your stuff, the smith in this town is the place to buy all your stuff. He sells weapons, armor, and the other junk people sell to him _below_ list price. Towns like Holtburg and Rithwic sell at list, but here is the only place that sells below list. A consideration when starting out alone without a patron. Like other starter towns, his basic stock stuff doesnt go beyond chainmail and low-end weapons (no Tachis or Yoroi, for instance), but occasionally you will find good stuff that folks sell. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zimbalt 5/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An excellent place to find vassals.  Expect about a third of them to rip you off and you wont be disappointed. &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shoushi is the coolest, that aside like most (if not all) newbie towns, the mage now sells tapers! &lt;I&gt;	-- Jan01Patch 1/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>N.W. Beach fort with mage, healer, peddler buy/selling weapons, armor, health kits, lockpicks, arrows, other items&lt;BR&gt;NPCs here are a healer, weaponer, peddler and mage.  Cant sell food, armor, jewlery (peddler buys gems). Mage has very limited components. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 3/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mage there will trade the following: A Pyreal Mote for a hint on the herb for the ring spells, a Pyreal Sliver for a hint on the talisman for the ring spells, a pyreal Nugget for 5 Diamond Scarabs, a Pyreal Bar for a scroll of Eye of the Storm. &lt;I&gt;	-- Polecat 7/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the place to get your ore refined in the hollow/ravenous weapons quests.. Outside there are some Goldenback tuskers and drudge stalkers.. occasionally some Shadows. &lt;I&gt;	-- Jade Al-Youh 10/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mage there is the middle character, and he gives other scrolls for pyreal bars, I got a Spike Strafe scroll from him. &lt;I&gt;	-- Fourpius 12/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you wish to get your chunks of chorizite refined, there is a Quest-timer on the NPC. its 16.30 hours. &lt;I&gt; -- Der Nominator 12/14/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Faruza ibn Salaq is the name of the NPC &lt;I&gt; -- Og of Olothi 2/20/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To get here easily: 1) Go to Mayoi, locate the settlements portal (60.8S, 80.3E). 2) Jump in the Lady Malia Estates Portal.  Be ready for Northern Osteth creatures (Banderlings, Drudges, Niffis, Monougas, etc). 3) Run to the Beach Fort at the above coordinates. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne, LC 4/28/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Nice screenshot.&lt;BR&gt;The inscription on the stone was changed to Commemorating one year since Asherons Call first brought intrepid adventurers to Dereth.  This change happened, as one would expect, around the one year anniversary of Asherons Call. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hiro Okisho 11/17/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Does anyone know what finding all of these stones will do? &lt;I&gt;	-- rmr11 12/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

From here run NNE to 53N, 13W, and from there to Igloo LS at 70.4N, 17.2W, then into town.  This route avoids the thick high-level drudge and tusker herds that populate the lowlands south and west of Stonehold.

    <description>Savage entered this&lt;BR&gt;This is the exit point for the Carved Caves portal to the Direlands. This spot is usually safe, but monsters abound on all sides.  Just north is a rock with cavern underneath.  The fastest way to continue to HOLL is to follow the ridge south to a temple building and take the portal there. Be prepared for action. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 5/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You will definitely want to tie here on your way to the Halls of Lost Light from the Carved Caves, as the run is very brutal for mid-level characters. &lt;I&gt; -- Wylfghar 12/28/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Small Garundim town on the road south from Zaikhal&lt;BR&gt;spice merchant there sells hot pepper, oregano,and cinnamon &lt;I&gt; 5/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best price for Armor Piercing Arrows I have found &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Very good AP arrow prices (100/625p), however the roaming bowyers at various locations around the countryside sell them at cost (100/500p). The most easily accessable roamer is in a house by 3 cows on the NW road just outside of Cragstone. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zimbalt 10/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is also a collector there that will transform a variety of monster heads into masks. &lt;I&gt; 10/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;GREAT town for levels 6-15! Fun dungeons, good loot, uncrowded (except for the golem cave), and if outdoor action is your thing, the monouga houses are not to be missed! Lack of a jeweler and archmage will keep you portalling down to Khayyaban but the two-way portal makes for a quick trip. The popularity of the golem cave with campers is probably all that keeps Al-Jalima from becoming a ghost town like Samsur (Solclaim). &lt;I&gt;	-- Hu Pong 11/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Al-Jalima now has an archmage, hes in the same shop as the healer. This town is still an excellent place to level early in your teens, but the Forbidden Crypt and the Golem Cave (its actually a mine) are crowded 75% of the time (Thistledown). &lt;I&gt;	-- Grimshaw 1/13/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spice Merchant is VERY expensive&lt;br&gt; the one in Plateau Village has much better prices. &lt;I&gt;	-- Wa Chen (MT) 1/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Home to the Shadows Garb mask maker Janda Sulifia. Give a Virindi mask in exchange for Shadows Garb mask (mummy mask) AL 190 Staff mastery IV Gharu only Staff 180 &lt;I&gt; -- Chryon 7/7/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

No one around to pick them though :) -2/11/01 &lt;I&gt;	-- Rayn Brun of FF 2/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The critters dont stay near to the tower so you need to lure em. Good for level 10 to 12 warriors as well as mages because lifestone is so near in case of emergency. Some easy beach action too. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zulu Njomo 2/23/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Place with Snowy Mattekars&lt;BR&gt;Mostly Great Mattekars. some ice golem also. Dungeon is small. &lt;I&gt;	-- Ken-sai 9/26/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you fall in the pit at the end of the dungeon the portal takes you to a bandit castle which is way east, the road takes you back to the crater castle but its a long run. There is also another portal which even goes further east. &lt;I&gt;	-- Skystreak 10/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you came looking for hide... you came to the wrong place! 15+ people here at all times! WAY TOO CROWDED! &lt;I&gt;	-- Unikz 11/23/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well actually theres not as many people as you say there are.  the most ive seen there at the same time was 5.  and theres always enough matts for everyone there. &lt;I&gt;	-- nemo 12/7/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh, the place is much more crowded than that at all times now. Never seen less than 10 people there at once. &lt;I&gt;	-- Balder of Staal 1/30/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Its crowded alright.  I entered when there were only 500 ppl on the whole server (Leafcull) and there were 10+ ppl in here then.  All of them take the everything that spawns and all the loot is mine attitude - I got heavily flamed for getting some loot off a Great I had helped kill... I wasnt best pleased after having them jump all over my kills earlier... the language started to fly then :)grrr Sometimes I wish we could pk whoever, whenever... :) Virtually all Greats here, the very occasional snowy or white.  The pit at the end spawns ice golems.  If you want loot jump in here as the Matties tend to do that themselves, get killed by the campers above who then leave the corpses. &lt;I&gt;	-- Laz al-Farah 3/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i was here for about 3 hours BY MYSELF,and only saw one person after that &lt;I&gt;	-- scarfacebt  11/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I go there quite freq, on LC. 1-5 people there at any given time. &lt;I&gt;	-- rmr11 12/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good staging point to hoard the Great Mattekar Horns for the Composite Bow. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As of this day, nothing is spawning inside the dungeon..another casualty of the dreaded updates &lt;I&gt; -- Melkor 1/4/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Melkor I dont know where you got that idea, but I was just in there 5 min ago, and there were matties all over the place! mostly snowy and great and a few white.Its kinda late so I didnt see 1 person except for the friend I brought along ---Archer of Magic &lt;I&gt; -- Archer of Magic 5/10/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Levels 1-6. NE of Samsur. &lt;BR&gt; Entered By Dunc&lt;BR&gt;Object of a welcome letter quest. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khrome-Khoran 9/19/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Locked door to library here. Not sure if there are keys, or you need to pick it. &lt;I&gt;	-- PDQ Blues 6/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The key can be obtained from the exploerer society agent  north west of Samsur. he is in a tent next to the advocates tower. The dungeon used to provide an endless upply oif Books which meant easy XP cash and potions. Had a nice little chatroom feeling going in the line most nights but it got nerfed in the recent update now you need to wait 2 or 3 days before getting a second book. &lt;I&gt; -- Satsujinki 1/10/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level restriction is now 1-20.  Find your Samsur  Town Stamp next to the exit portal in the entranceway. &lt;I&gt;-- Ankhentomen 3/30/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is an essential lifestone, if you are going to enter the Crater Pathway Portal, nice and peaceful here. &lt;I&gt;	-- Taylric 10/11/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also handy before you enter the matty cave &lt;I&gt;	-- Polgera 1/1/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An exellent lifestone for low Lvls (18 and under) to base from.  Especially useful for those without melee D.  Within yards of the stone (although you seem in relative safety at the stone) are a few Limestone Golems and masses of Wood Golems.  Loot is non-existant but xp earned in abundance here by low Lvls.  A large open rolling area,  suitable for ranged and melee types. &lt;I&gt;	-- Laz al-Farah 3/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>lvls 1-6&lt;BR&gt;First few lvls mostly Streths &lt;I&gt; 9/17/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Compass shows the portal and a Shreth, but the portal seems to be underground? &lt;I&gt;	-- Kephrin 2/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a quest amid this place. You get an axe called Brogers axe in the bottom, and give it to the lady in the bar, and get rewarded with something. To get the key into the room, you have to do most of the welcome letter quest &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 3/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brogords Axe is the payoff from the Holtburg welcome letter quest.  Its on the 2nd floor.  The place is swarming with gnawer shreths on insanely fast respawn, a couple carrions at the bottom.  Great xp if you dont get swarmed. &lt;I&gt;	-- Chi Domkwai 3/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brogords Axe is, for the most part, useless.  Speed 70, damage 3-7, no magic at all.  Doesnt sell for much more than a hand axe.  Give it to the woman in Holtburg and get 6 healing tonics for your troubles.  Overall, the quest is fairly easy for warrior types.  Should complete it by lvl 3 or 4. &lt;I&gt;	-- Regis 4/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brogords Axe useless for the most part? Bah! Pay no mind to the above person. Its a very decent starter axe...the actual, truthful stats on it are as follows: 7-13 slashing (NOT 3-7), with a slow-60 speed (not 70). Some of the best stats available next to an Atlan. Its also worth only 280p, so you are unlikely to drop it when you die. For beginning axe users, its thus a very worthwhile quest. &lt;I&gt;-- Zimbalt 5/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is where you get the Holtburg town stamp for the newbie letter quests. So the dungon is now accessable to people of up to level 20. Brogords axe is now on a quest timer too. &lt;I&gt;	-- Armin 12/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Latest info on the reward for turning in the axe: you get 2 health potions (25 hlth boost), 1000XP, and 200p. I use sword so for a low-level person its probably worth it. &lt;I&gt; -- Soyan 6/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;lvl 1-20 is the right restriction level. &lt;I&gt; -- Greeneye 9/22/2001 &lt;/i&gt; This dungeon has been moved to 41.8N 32.1E from 42.3N, 29.3E as of the December 2004 patch. &lt;I&gt;-- Armin 12/8/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>An old Empyrean fort with a really interesting generator...&lt;BR&gt;Last time I was visited, there were two Shadowchildren, a Shadow Leuitenant, and one other Shadow thing, not sure what it was.  That leuitenant was tossing level 2 war spells around. &lt;I&gt;	-- Polecat 9/15/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;lvl 5 war spells.  75+damage.  Caution advised. &lt;I&gt;	-- Wayne 9/19/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was also recently there and there is a shadow captian as well. Level 61. Run like h*ll. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kal Wolfe 9/28/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;a.k.a Temple of the Shadows. This is also an Interest Point. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 10/2/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh look a shadow lieutenant, he casts a firebolt at me.  BOOM! Im dead.  I had 89 hits at the time.  If you see him..... heed the advice of others.... RUN &lt;I&gt;	-- Taylric 10/11/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Note, for Life mages... you can sit behind a wall and Harm things for lots of easy XP. &lt;I&gt; 10/22/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;unless u can take LVL 5 warspells on the chin and live, dont even think of going there &lt;I&gt;	-- Origy 11/13/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Went with a group and had Mages act as bait for the Lieutenant. For our efforts and deaths we got a pice of parchment out of one chest and a Brass Acid Tofun and some sort of magic shield out of the other.  Not worth being burned to a cinder by the Shadow Lieutenant. &lt;I&gt;	-- Ronin Cheshire 12/30/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I never got that close of a look at this place, but with all the suspicion about the shadows lately, I think that theres something else going on here besides a bunch of shadows living in an Empyrean Power Plant, and I think that thing in the middle, the ash stuff I read about, and the shadow in the sky on the Northern Horizon have something to do about this... &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 3/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At lvl 26 i took 2 lvl 20s and a lvl 19...all but one person was slain...they had about taken the wussier shadows while i fought the Lt. With thanks to the update, he now HEALS like nothing B4! I had him almost dead...then was blasted by Flame Bolt V...the others soon joined me at the Lifestone... &lt;I&gt;	-- Sword Nut,ThDwn 6/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;Area around this place is far tougher now than inside, but the Shadows remain. Also a portal nearby to Direlands. &lt;I&gt;-- Charles 7/25/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The dungeon in which the Sword of Lost Light is acquired.  There is a portal to this dungeon at the bottom of the Carved Caves near Al-Jalima.  Seven keys retrieved from across the land are required to enter the chamber with the sword.  It is guarded by the Guardian of Lost Light.  This is probably a level 40+ quest.  Keys are as follows: Shoushi Grotto: If you are in a throne room with a portal off to the right, and you are not at the beginning of the dungeon, you are there.  You have to go up a ramp into the throne room. Holtburg Dungeon:  Take the first left each time (a right turn might be most left option), until you see white rat(s).  One of the rats has the key. Rithwic Crypt:  Its on a white rat on the 2nd level down.  You have to open a door somewhere to get down. Dungeon Manor (Samsur).  Find the stairs down.  Go to the left I think.  There should be a hallway, with mroe stairs down into a farily large room with drudges.  One of the drudges has the key. Yaraq Tunnels: Go to bottom of dungeon (there should be a gate near stairs.  Go somewhat right until you upon a room with 3 rooms branching off from it.  2 rooms have 3 cages in them, the other doesnt.  Somewhere in here is the key. Yanshi Tunnels:  I forgot :-) The last is in Carved Caves, and hardest to get.  You MUST have a full set of keys. All of the doors requiring keys are listed as UNPICKABLE. Every sword fighter should complete this quest - the Sword may not be the best, but its a great status symbol, especially once converted into the SoLH. &lt;I&gt; -- Flamelord -- Bonehead -- Nether -- Jarl -- Jain the Huntress -- Vylarn -- Wylfghar  &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>No level restrictions, however I would not recommend low level characters try out this dungeon. Has Azure Gromnies (acid-breathing), liches and, Im told, a Lich Lord. There are two exit portals to the surface that I know of.&lt;BR&gt;Near Rithwic. Asherons Altar (removes +pvp status) lies at the very bottom of this pit. Beware, Liches and Lich Lords haunt this place. &lt;I&gt;	-- Caeryn Dryad 9/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Will need Lockpick if you wish to get to Asherons Alter.  Lots of liches and a lich lord near the end, also has Trothyrs Shield, buts it quite pathetic &lt;br&gt;) &lt;I&gt;	-- Impa 11/24/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not sure about needing lockpick, i didnt when doing this dungeon, but you can by the key @ appler seller &lt;I&gt;	-- infoMAN 1/8/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Has a Chest towards the Left side of dungeon with a Lich Lord and 5 liches guarding it. It spawns some decent 2k-5k Items. &lt;I&gt;	-- Gem  [DT] 2/9/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Neither the entrance nor the exit portals are tieable &lt;I&gt; -- Hexxor 7/28/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Banderling Tower near Rithwic.  Chests up top.  Lots of stuff in the surrounding area (in particular in the hills to the east) to whack when the tower is already camped (blood/hunter/vorous shreths, pup/adult/veteran reedsharks, etc) -- Iron Fist McGee&lt;BR&gt;This is the Interest Point SE of Rithwic. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 11/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;this is a great place for lvl 10+ mages/archers to lvl up solo and lvl 10+ melee fighters in group. the chest is uber for newbies and u can get some very nice armor if u want color cordinated armor  &lt;I&gt;	-- Ulv the Viking  1/6/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Be wary of this location if you have trouble fighting massive numbers at once.  Killing the banderlings camped inside the tower will cause a swarm of lower level bandies to approach the tower from all directions.. Ive encountered 50+ Banderlings at once in this manner.. &lt;I&gt; -- Mirions 2/17/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Lugian Tower along the road between Qalabar and Kahyyaban(?). A couple of them (lvl33) plus allot of black rats. Didnt hang out long... :). Entered by Dunc.&lt;BR&gt;Excellent location to gain XPs for Mages and Archers. If youre fast and buffed you can sprint through the Lugians (1 Lithos, 1 Obeleth, 2+ Amploth, 3+ Laigus) and climb the stairs. Watch for the rocks thrown by the Obeleth and the Amploth. Once inside you can leisurely pick up several thousand XPs in an afternoon. For Mages, I recommend lvl 10 or above. &lt;I&gt;	-- Xalaq 2/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Minor corrections: 1 Lit far out front (S), 1 Obe and 2 Amp in close out front,1 Lai to the NW in close,and 1 Lai to the NE farther out. Total 6. Use the LS in Khaf &lt;I&gt;	-- Elindel 2/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;DANGEROUS SINCE LAST UPDATE!

Skeletons, warriors, skeleton captains, liches and a lich lord. &lt;I&gt; -- Six&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ok dont go here not at all the monsters on the way [that] will kill you including more than 5 golems skellie captain you name it it will be there!!!!!!! &lt;I&gt;	-- ME 9/21/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont be a wuss ME. Getting theres easy if you go straight from Samsur Outpost. Once inside, dont jump off at the beware sign unless youre lvl25+ or want to die and lose your stuff. Did I say 25? Make that 30+. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khrome-Khoran 10/20/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Study Iron key opens chest in lich pit. Magic items in this chest are almost always Ghru only. &lt;I&gt;	-- Shoto Fle-Alch 5/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance to dungeon usually hosts a jolly monster convention, with mucho boneheads and bonehead warriors. If youre adventuring solo, getting in is your first challenge! At level 16 I had to draw em away from the entrance a few at a time and layeth the smacketh down before I could enter. Once inside, the upper floors of this dungeon must have the politest and most well-mannered skeleton warriors Ive ever seen. If you dont do something dumb like go booming into a group of them, Ive seen them come up to you one at a time for leisurely wailing. Big phun! &lt;I&gt;	-- Hu Pong 12/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Run in from the north is not a problem &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/12/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Route to North Direlands is through the valley, with a high ridge on your left.  Keep going south, you will cross farmland (must be farmland, theres lots of Auroch Fire Bulls there) until you get to north terminus of Ridge Route into Direlands. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/12/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jeweler in town that will buy your goodies ... and Ka Ku-to near the windmills sells Plate Armor.

    <description>Dungeon is along the road from the Samsur East Outpost. Didnt see any rats when I was here. Drudges, three Outcast Monougas behind a locked door which they dont seem to see as a major obstacle and will take swings at you through it. Good for wall-working! Nice, clean, simple architecture with single gnawer shreths and packs of drudges (3 or 4 at a time). Drudge group on lower level drops some nifty loot. This is a must-visit for newbies! &lt;I&gt;	-- Hu Pong 11/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Fort with portal to Zaikhal (), also a lifestone. Tuskers and banders outside. &lt;I&gt; -- Hot Pants&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is also an Interest Point. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 10/3/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This area will be of particular interest to war mages and archers in 8-15 range: posting points are excellent, monsters are nearby, lifestone is nearby, portals are nearby to haul out loot, only problem is the long run in. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;dont try the long run in if you do not have the help of at least two firends of lvl 30+, or you will have to try a dozen times to get there from the next lifestone. To enter the fort use the chests to get over the wall. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hagen der Hexer 8/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is awsome for anyone level 10 to 14 mainly archers and mages. There is usually a Ursin spawn (Lvl 16)X2 and a Fragment spawn (LVL 29). Jump off the boxes and head had a tad off West to the south and you hit the bander fort. Which is surrounded by Ursins/Tuskers/Banderlings/Monoguas all 15th to 17th. Nice place to hunt for a group. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kublah Kai, MT 1/9/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spawn near heres changed since the last time I was here.  Expect Drudge Lurkers, Stalkers, Crimson and Goldenback Tuskers, and Esper Ursuins.  Great hunting if you survive the run in!  &lt;I&gt;	-- Ibn Schachabo 2/7/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spawn changed again! Now expect Magus,Leeches, Virindi/Tusker groups, Basalt and Nepidious Golems, Legionaries and so forth. Nice quiet hunting spot, spawns within castle bow shot. &lt;I&gt; -- Rigor 6/19/2003 &lt;/i&gt;You can finda  portal to the East Dires directly east of the fort with in view of it. Thats the nifty think about. Plus the loads of 60 ~ 80ish mobs all around.  &lt;I&gt;-- Kublah Kai 10/1/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Dungeon near Rithwic, restricted to Level 3 or greater. Not too hard, lots of banderling guards, and drudges &lt;I&gt; -- Cicero&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;correction: no banderling guards there... just young ones... &lt;B&gt;Rated: &lt;I&gt;Cheesy&lt;/i&gt; Lvl: 3-8&lt;/B&gt;&lt;I&gt;	-- Ihad 9/23/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No upper level restriction. &lt;I&gt;	-- Mad Dugan 10/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Has a ?royal cabbage? &lt;I&gt;	-- Dicer-DT 3/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Has rats, drudges, weaker shreaths, and banders. One skeleton in a room with loot better than other monsters in the area. Theres a tiny cave where four young banders spawn. An ok camping spot. However, the name Filos Doom doesnt mean much - probably the skeleton. Good solo spot for Lv6+ &lt;I&gt;	-- Zarkon 5/17/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Has several doors that are operated by levers. Not a bad spot to take newcomers to. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sirfrey 6/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great spot.  Some shreths in the first room, then basically banderlings and rats from there on.  A room with a few drudges (slinkers mostly). &lt;I&gt;	-- Dryah II 8/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The room across from where the Skeleton lives spawns healing food on the floor.  Royal Cabbage, Special Cheese, and Salmon appear at random and will replenish your health a small bit.  To access the room, you need to pull the lever in the room with the skeleton. &lt;I&gt;	-- Cuttler Strngmd 9/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NOTE: Checked out this dungeon 11/09/2000 and found a strange phenomenon. Although the purple blip was there, there was no portal to be seen. I stood directly over the blip and there was nothing! Very Odd. &lt;I&gt;	-- Naala 11/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Umm... Naala, the dungeon entrance in a small cave. &lt;I&gt;	-- Neo Lee DT 11/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;this portal has disappeared, at least in Solclaim. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hagen II 11/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont go to the exact coordinates of the dungeon, theres a cave nearby that leads down to the portal. Also, at the bottom there was an empty chest! Was there supposed to be something in there? &lt;I&gt;-- Riki-Kiki-Taco 12/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Youll notice on map when u run from rithwik to estham thsi place suckes you shouldnt even young bandies drudges rats 1skeleton somtimes it has wands,orbs.items spawn in a room whith a russet rat and 2 bandies mostly tappers wands powders and mana stone..btw the stones have no mana sucks totaly skip it....  &lt;I&gt;	-- rabbithunter 4/10/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;... ... ... Right, rabbithunter, right... &lt;I&gt; -- Jibner 7/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;Now part of the Undead Mechanic quest, added in the October 2003 patch.  &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 11/12/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Limited to level 5 and above. Filled with Skeletons, Skeleton Warriors, and maybe Skeleton Captain. &lt;I&gt; -- Houdani&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NO skele capns, but a new skele lord (lvl 34) in room behind door tripped by lever upstairs &lt;I&gt;	-- Karlos 10/2/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the 11/23 patch, it is now levels 5-10 only.  So much for a good exp pool for the monks! &lt;I&gt;	-- Vlanna 11/23/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A dungeon with a level 34 creature is limited to level 10 at the most? HELLO?? Also, the skeleton lord has a Key from the mage academy (atleast it did before the 11/23 patch). &lt;I&gt;	-- Scythen 12/19/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Skeleton Lord gives a cursed key which weight for 1000BU, it cannot be given and it doesnt open the door to mage academy &lt;I&gt;	-- Xin 12/26/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Correction. The key do open a door there.. &lt;I&gt;	-- Xin 12/27/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The cap is now 10th level, its now 5-10. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 1/30/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you find a black rock, a mage at 6.1N, 3.5E (far side of Al-Jalima) is looking for it. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/13/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is great never found a black rock but if you jump down the east hole and run through the fake wall to the left is a pickable chest and in the room with the lord is a great chest if you can trap the skeletons in rooms you can make 25k in one night easy &lt;I&gt;	-- lorthos 2/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;LOL  25k in one night!! Really!! Whether thats Pyreals or Xp your talking about thats pathetic :) &lt;I&gt; 4/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mage Doesnt want a Black rock   He want a black GEM From an undead probaly in the Burial Temple.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Wistiu Li Cho 8/19/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cursed Key dropped by Skel Lord opens door at Mage Academy that will lead you to Lord Rytheran. Also Black Gem is a portal gem that will provide portal to MA when given to NPC mentioned above. See my entry at Mage Academy. Since level restrict is 5-10 now should have high level friend provide ultra-buffs so killing the skel lord is possible.  &lt;I&gt;	-- AllyMcAlchemist 11/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Between Al-Arqas and Yaraq. Loads of Skeletons. Pointless to go alone as it takes at least two to open the doors. And make sure on of them is a lockpicker &lt;I&gt; -- Ollathair&lt;/i&gt;Now the third (of 20!) stops in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. You dont need to know lockpick if you have any kind of decent jump skill. Only one lever was required to get to the alloy piece. &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 11/12/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Banderlings (including a few ravers) and Mite Scamps &lt;I&gt; -- Ollathair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;if u stick to the left wing off the main  entrance room, you will find one banderling scout and rooms each with a lev 8 mite. If u stay there and kill htese as they respawn treasure, in form of jewelry, is quite good. &lt;I&gt;	-- Pendragon 11/19/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you take the right wing, you can go down to a lower level (with a couple of sub-levels below) with Ravers, Raiders, Guards, and several decent chests.  There is a second exit portal down there as well. &lt;I&gt;	-- TreeFellow 11/24/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I believe it is called the Smugglers Hideaway, also there is a captain, but the less people that know where he is the better. &lt;I&gt;	-- Manxer 11/24/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thats why I didnt mention the Cap &lt;br&gt;)  There is also a breeder that everyone seems to miss, thou he isnt hidden... just out of the way. &lt;I&gt;	-- TreeFellow 12/9/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The portal to the actual dungeon has a level 8 or higher restriction on it. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vexorg 1/31/00 &lt;/i&gt;Stop #10 in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 11/14/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Take the north road from Qalabar most of the way.  Lots of lugians.  Expect to be hit by a couple Lithos as soon as you get in. &lt;I&gt; -- Zing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this dungeon there is a hidden room:  go down the stair and to the left.  there are more stairs&lt;br&gt; take them.  You will be in a room with more lugies and stairs going up&lt;br&gt; take the stairs going up.  Quickly turn around and run into the left wall in the far corner.  You will be in a hidden hall the lugies cant get to.  You can safely cast life spells on the lugies and get tons of xp.  (I did this when i was Level 3) &lt;I&gt;	-- X-CreaToR 10/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Over populated. Usually 10+ people there. If your not a life mage, attack from the top of stairs or boxes. Remember, warriors: their head is the most vulnerable spot on them. &lt;I&gt;	-- Unikz 11/14/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think you all are talking about the Lugy Bunker just north of town. In the forked trail you will not find stairs or secret room, but you will find tons of lugys, including sometimes a GIGA Lugy. &lt;I&gt;	-- Andreas vanHaus 11/21/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You are right. Giga rock throwing nasty luggies are up here. Pyreal armor rumored to respawn in a safe in there... I gotta check that rumor out, I never made it that far. &lt;I&gt;	-- Unikz 11/23/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes and also make sure your with a group. Right when you enter your in a skinny hallway and behind you and infront of you are rockthrowing laigus lugians and rocky armadillos. No escape from there. &lt;br&gt;) &lt;I&gt;	-- Xzeno 12/4/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is no longer any goo armor or items to be found here.  The Gigas in the end guards a chest with 1-2 plain-excellent healing kits :( &lt;I&gt;	-- Shang Di 12/21/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The chest spawns Greater Mana Stones too.  Decent death items at least. &lt;I&gt; 3/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the insides camped, sometimes the outside has a better spawn.  Usually Lithos and Obeloth outside, Laigus to start with inside, all the way up to Gigas along the way.  Group highly reccomended. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield Bond 3/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If it was crowded, not anymore. 3-5 people here on busy days. Decent loot and XP if dangerous. Bring a party unless you can take on 3 laigus lugians at a time, and possibly two lithos. If hunting outside (decent stuff there too, if you havent read above note) beware stamina eaters, weak monsters put in to make you lose stamina against the lithos. One really close to Forking Trail portal, they stop spawning though. &lt;I&gt;	-- Rimgar 8/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Find one of Jong Mis writings in a chest behind a locked door and give it to Dai Ja the Scholar in Yanshi. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kara Gandharvi 12/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Reedsharks galore, a few desert/swamp rats &lt;I&gt; -- Alun Magus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is also a portal to the North Desert edge dropoff inside... &lt;I&gt;	-- Twisted Sword 10/19/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reedsharks, reedsharks, and more reedsharks.  Watch out if youre heading for the desert portal, its possible to get jumped by 10+ sharks on the bridge.  The last bridge spans a pit containing rats, at least one is a level 26 silver rat.  Loot isnt real good, but the xp isnt too bad--good place to work off some vitae. &lt;I&gt;	-- Chi Domkwai 3/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The pit is the main attraction of this dungeon eventhough the locked chest no longer spawn good loot. The fall into the pit will do anywhere from 25-60 dmg depending on your jumping skill and if you hit the wall or not. As soon your feet hit the ground youll be surrounded by 3 sliver rats, 3-4 swamp rats and a few sharks...youll also suffer constant 3-4 fire damage from the heat. Bring your melee D and lots of stam since the spawn rate is furiously fast. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kexin 3/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;very good place to lvl, from 10 up to 16 it took 2 days ,also good source for low lvl jewelery ! I never jumped down the pit but when u want to get over the bridge u have to pull only one switch ,if u pull both the door will be closed again &lt;I&gt;	-- Shou Lin 6/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Someone seems to have neglected to mention a level restriction to this place.  Im level 7,  and cant get in. &lt;I&gt;	-- Alec DuThane 2/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Nothing else to do here if you cant get inside. &lt;I&gt;	-- Nether 12/21/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a location to get a key to get inside. You must give an item to a man somewhere and he shall give you the key, I wont spoil it and tell you where thou. Jain the Huntress &lt;I&gt; 12/31/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I dont know how to get the key but you can open two dorrs by using } key to get lever and then press R to open  &lt;I&gt;	-- Lorthos 2/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Greetings Friends, I am planning on making a mapping run next week which I will announce on CODs HarvestGain board. I wouldnt mind a spoiler on the key since Im more interested in the internals. Going through the dungeon you will find lots of undead, Skele Captains, Liches, 3 lesser Mi Muyahs, a Greater MiMuyah, at the very bottom is a room with a lich lord (watch them bolts!) and a button. Also a room with a double button which I have not found what it does yet. -Liu Kui Unarmed Locksmith of HarvestGain &lt;I&gt;	-- Liu Kui 3/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I however, shall, Jain the Huntress.  The point of the atlas is to give spoiler information about little-known areas, NOT to skulk around dropping vague hints and misspelling the word though.  Ya give one o dem lich skull majigs to a guy at the interest point SE of the mines, coordinates 75.9s 57.3e for the key. Sometimes known as THE TURTLE!!! and the King o Bleh, &lt;I&gt;	-- Magwitch 5/24/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take your little problems off ACspedia and complain elsewhere plz Magwitch. This is now the site for the Focus Stone Quest.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Lifestone Golem 2/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Home of the Focus Stone as of Feb patch.  Getting the stone requires two keys: they are acquired by giving Li Ae-Rae (nearby) a Lich skull (from Grievous Vault), and a High Acolyte skull (from the Three Towers Quest).  He will give you two keys for doors in the dungeon. The Focus Stone itself comes from the Lich Overseer mid-way through.  The stone must be charged up at the orange vortex at the end of the dungeon.  There is switch and button pushing involved, and facing up to Decaying Warriors, Fleshless Warriors (60th, acid) and Unstable Magma Golems (fire).   &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Li Ae-Rea now gives you both keys when you give him a High Acolyte Skull. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 12/18/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

There are skeleton warriors, tumeroks of various levels, and drudge lurkers.  These are all archer types and they dont chase.  They are there to pepper anyone coming through.  Fastest way out is to head up the hill.  There are other mobile nasties in the area, and theres a portal to a small dungeon just north of the exit.  This is something of a haven. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/17/00 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>As of today, this is the correct location of Nanto. &lt;I&gt; -- Sun Tse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lame place. Dont even bother trying to level up with a new guy here. Only start in this town if you plan to go to Mayoi. &lt;I&gt;	-- Yasiv 2/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Decent hunting between here and Mayoi. Zefirs, Lugians, Ravers and Limestone Golems to name a few of the beasties that will want to play with you.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Warblade Prime 5/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As starter towns go, the hunting is a bit too rough. But is youre in your teens, its a Happy Hunting Ground. Run southwest from the weapons shop for about 1 minute (just past the waterfall) as you crest the hill, you will find many brown dots starting to appear on your radar. Lugians, mosswarts, monnougas, shreth, wasps, banderlings, reedsharks, and the occasional golem or zefir. The Rats Nest dungeon is located around this area. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zyban 7/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nanto is a good place to start a mule that you want to get to one of the southern towns like Lin or Mayoi.  Other than that, I havent found it that interesting. &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Its an excellent area to get up into the teens, if you know the terrain. The provisioner pays quite well for lockpicks. &lt;I&gt;	-- Ognam 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>I found this place while exploring the land, it is only accessible by running and there is no portal away. It contains 2 lesser Mu-miyah's and 1 greater Mu-miyah. Careful the greater can cast lvl IV warspells and is situated and the back of the tomb. Also very easy to get trapped in there so be wary. &lt;I&gt; -- Origy&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is also a statue here of a demon or winged beast that strongly resembles the shadowy figure currently appearing in the Dereth skys (Shadows of the Past).&lt;I&gt; -- Lita 3/4/2000 &lt;/I&gt;Greater Mu-miyah is Leikotha herself, who drops the Broken Haft, a piece needed for the Silifi of Crimson Stars quest axe. :) &lt;I&gt; -- Lorelai 4/7/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One of the coffins inside requires a sturdy iron key to open.

    <description>A castle full of banderling. Ranging from Raiders to captains. &lt;I&gt; -- Prome&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And Tumerok Workers and Warriors. This is your basic Direlands Tumerok open fort repopulated with banderlings instead. There is also one banderling Chief, and 5 chests with jems/food. Decent mid-level xp if you like killing piles of banderlings :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Lo Pang-Jo 1/2/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Boy, did I get a funny surprise while exploring the little hidey-hole in the center of this fort. I got a Camping Expertise spell cast on me accompanied with an amusing visual. From the spells description, it Increases the chance of finding phat loot.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Sixfingers 10/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>As a point of interest it is a large room with a Lifestone inside, a Rejuvenating Fountain and most importantly 3 portals leading to Samsur, Lytelthorpe and Yanshi. There is no monsters and the place is simply one big hall. Its purpose is probably to serve as a hall between the 3 worlds. &lt;I&gt; -- Caeryn Dryad&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Serves as a home for many various guilds. Including PK guilds and NPK guilds. Quite a nice hideaway =) &lt;I&gt;	-- Skorn 5/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Lifestone on the southern beach, on the east end of the land bride to the Dires. To the north, in a canyon, are 6+ Skeletons guarding a chest... I didn't get a chance to kill them and see what was in there though... &lt;I&gt; -- Dunc&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There were 2 Skeleton Warriors and 3 skeletons. the chest had 2 jems and 2 rings, not of much value. DO NOT run to this from the road, you will jump off the cliff and die. Go back to the lifestone east and go down to the beach to reach this spot. &lt;I&gt;	-- Gune 9/2/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why not get a separate entry for this amazing skeleton spawn... chest loot is not atypical for skeleton warriors and skeletons. Lifestone is one of the best direland border lifestones, with low to midlevel mobs near the stone and granite golems, banderling ravers, tumeroks and the like to the west. Also, to the east along the beach is a monolith with a permanent spawn of three sandy armordilloes.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Afreyt 9/7/2000 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>This dungeon is populated by the Lord Cambarth and his minions. The source of the Water of Lethe, rumoured to cleanse people of their memories and pains. There is also a PK Altar here created by Lord Cambarth and his men. The population include Virindi Masters, Magma Golems, Sear Guard, Obsidian Golem, Virindi Servants and Lord Cambarth himself and his Foreman Brelax. Note: You need to go to the very bottom to finish the Quest. &lt;I&gt; -- Caeryn Dryad&lt;BR&gt;Outside is the spawning point for the Sword of Lost Light infusion elemental. I believe it is a Hellfire or a Firestorm. -- Nocturne, LC 7/14/2002  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/4/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon dates back to beta days. It is medium-size with good eye-candy and winding corridors. Theres a room with mild mana-sucking crystals. Lockpick is helpful. The exit portal room near Lord Cambrith has an easily missed corridor down, to the right of the portal. This leads to the waters of Lethe. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/4/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This portal is close to a small Tower in the South Direlands, surrounded by some unfriendly Tumeroks. Its not far away from the place where u respawn when u take the portal from Mayoi to South Direlands. I jumped into it thinking it would be some kind of cool dungeon (Portal is called Slaughterhouse). Well - I ended up in a real Slaughterhouse - or better slaughter-area. U respawn between two castles/forts in the North Direlands. Tons of Golden Wasps, Silver Rats, Vorous Shreths, Tumerok Shamans, Granite Golems, Bronze Armoredillos, and Level 58+ Drudges. A Fort with shops and Lifestone is not far away from the Slaughterhouse (Fort: 1.6N, 71.6W). Dont even think about showing up here alone! There is no portal-way out of the Slaughterhouse. Next portal is at the Fort 1.6N, 71.6W which ends up at Hilltop (between Cragstone/Glenden Wood) &lt;I&gt; -- Wishmaster&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fort is Fort Tethana and there is a lifestone a little south of it &lt;I&gt; -- Daven 10/25/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This portal exits at 0.4S, 80.1W&lt;/A&gt; &lt;I&gt; -- Stern 12/25/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before you go through, pick up a key off one of the tumeroks in the tower. It will open the gate to the Slaughterhouse fort at the other end of the portal.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/19/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This USE to be nice place to go!  Not anymore, unless you dont mind being broke that is... &lt;I&gt;	-- Yulof 3/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just visited my favorite Tumerok/Cattle hangout.

Beware that if you go booming right up to the tower youll get to see every drudge camp in the area sortie and head your way. Be careful of straying too far from the immediate area as there are skeletons, armoredillos and rust gromnies around that will not mind putting the smack-down on you. Lifestone nearby.

    <description>Drunken Madman here, speaking of removing Asherons protection. Want to be a red dot? Good hunting for lvl.7+ with ranged attacks(archer or magic) or higher for hand to hand. Immediate area has lugians (lvl.15+), golems (lvl.11+), Ivory Gromnie, mosswarts (creepers, feeders), Mattekars (white and snowy). Quite a run, better be tough and/or fast, careful not to get caught in unpassable mountain areas on approach. Not for the faint of heart. &lt;I&gt; -- Lila&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Official name: Ridge Tower &lt;I&gt;	-- Ghozer 11/8/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Drunken Madman requests a drink, I believe, I didnt have one to give him though &lt;I&gt;	-- Destructor 11/18/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drunken Madman requires one Saki for passage. &lt;I&gt;	-- Xirces 11/26/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Its Sake.. Buy it in Baishi.. and hes been Fizzling from what i hear.. &lt;I&gt;	-- Shaggz Two Dope 12/30/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hes fixed. &lt;I&gt;	-- Eviloce 2/1/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now inhabited by Shadow Lieutenants... not a good place for beginners at all. The drunk guy is still there... but dont go unless you are well prepared. The way up is filled with shadows as well. &lt;I&gt;	-- Gnad the Large 3/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shadows are there sometimes but not all the time.  No spawn points inside.  Dangerous but still not a bad place for 8th-12th level archers and war mages to powerlevel &lt;I&gt;	-- Tesslah 4/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This fort is a staging area for the Accursed halls.  At the Ridge Tower near Baishi you will find a Drunken Madman.  Give him Sake and he will open a Gateway to the Walled portals.  The outside Accursed Halls portal drops you out here.  It can be tied, but not summoned.  This is also a great staging point for the C-Note emissary to Aerlinthe Island.  &lt;I&gt; -- Yoshimura --  Nocturne -- Arrogant -- BuffDaddy&lt;/i&gt;

There was still a great many ice golems that spawn here. Theyll add up if you let them! Note: The life-stone hopping from Holtburg has gotten more perilous with the last AC update: you may encounter drudge lurkers or stalkers along the way. If your 13th-20th level with a run speed of 100 or greater, youll make it to Fort Drachensun (to the east) just fine. Lifestone there and come on out! Oh, and bring a flame sword!!! &lt;I&gt;	-- Sixfingers 7/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Mage inside selling minimal stuff &lt;I&gt; -- Stiletto&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This spot may be of interest to beginning war mage/archer types.  Good points: on-site lifestone, plenty of mid-level monsters within blasting distance of tower, and portal out.  Bad point: a long run in. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 5/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Mountain Castle with an Archmage, General Shopkeeper, and Weapon/Armorer.  Lifestone and portal to a Hilltop near  is here as well.  Lots of Banders, Monougas and Mites nearby for good Mid lvl (8~14) hunting. &lt;I&gt; -- Yoshimura&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tuskers can be found here as well... &lt;I&gt;	-- Polecat 11/25/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;addition: the merchant buys and sells lots of kinds of stuff, but the archmage offers a *very* limited variety of components -- dont expect to find what youve run out of... unless youve checked first.  Only mana stones with tiny charge are sold. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 2/3/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As of the August patch there is now also a collector here for rat tails, wings, scalps, etc. &lt;I&gt;	-- Virginia Plain 8/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is an excellent setup with one exception- not enough wildlife to hunt,  A good place to overnight on the way to Stonehold or the Mountain Castle, but if you made it this far you will probably find youtself wanting to move on.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The good Doc is, ah, not entirely correct. The archmage offers all components including tapers, up to silver scarabs.  His markup is 40%.  He buys the usual mage stuff at 80%. The bowyer sells arrows, quarrels, and AP arrows/quarrels at a 30% markup.  He doesnt sell AP heads, but he does sell arrow and quarrel shafts and normal heads. The merchant buys at 80% for most things&lt;br&gt; hes like a town provisioner.  He will not buy gems or jewelry. So not a bad little minitown, except theres no place to sell gems or jewelry. &lt;I&gt;	-- Red and Gold 2/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Doc was correct until the Jan. or Feb. 2001 patch.  Now all towns sell tapers and most comps. &lt;I&gt;	-- Servant-san 3/2/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Agree, the hunting is terrible! No Ravs, Stalkers or Lurkers, nope!  None at all. No Copper, Iron or Limestone golems either.  Not a one. No Great Matties. Nope, youll just want to move right along to somewhere else, especially since its soooo crowded with other people hunting the Young Banderlings and Red Phyntos wasps.  The hunting is soooo terrible that Im only making 15K exp. per buff cycle (at level 16), mostly hunting within sight of the town. &lt;I&gt; -- Dhambala al-T 8/31/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Lytelthrope is nearby and has almost everything a new mage or warrior can wish, also seems to be pretty quiet in the respect of PKs, you can usualy easely hit the town with your mule without being slaugtered by level 30+ ppls. This is a very good place to level up a newbie on Darktide. &lt;I&gt;	-- Oogy Wawa 12/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This used to be a Sclavus Castle, untill Morgluuk moved in.  Now it is the home to the Noble Weapon quest to slay Morgluuk.  There are 5 main dungeons here, which appear to be floating stones.  They dont show up as portals or items, but any 3rd party detectors will call them Vile-Smelling Refuse.  You must be flagged to enter by giving Captain Krank in Linvak Tukal Toberiks Report.  This report comes from the Renegade Fortress at 28.5S,65.5W.  It is givable, so send one person to stock up.
&lt;br&gt;Of the 5 main dungeons, 4 on ground level hold various ways to weaken Morgluuk, either by killing his Egg or by killing a Watcher and weakening his bodyguards.  The 5th is in a room near the top and contains Morgluuk -- Taarna Blood SC</description>

Some of the roughs can be picked off by lurking around the doorway and shooting inside. The outcasts will come out to play, but I havent seen the roughs do this yet. One came down to the doorway but went immediately back inside. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hu Pong 10/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Correction! That applies more to the companion Monouga House a little ways to the north. These roughs *will* come outside if you irritate them enough, and the critters camped nearby--hunter shreth, skeletons, rust gromnies, the odd broken fragment--makes this place a little iffy for low-levels. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hu Pong 10/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Its easy to use the walls such that you fight nmo more than 2 olthoi atta time.  If you have 250 jump you can still pech at the start by playing super mario of an olthois head/ &lt;I&gt;	-- Sarec 6/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But Archers, dont get all excited.  Perching here is pointless now because this dungeon has been ruined by a slower spawn rate.  So the amount of time youd spend perching, compared to the chance of actually seeing an Olthoi is totally pointless. &lt;I&gt;	-- T-Bird (HG) 9/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

If there is, I didnt see it. &lt;I&gt; -- LUMINO!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Are you crazy?  No treasure, one of the gems needed to make the silifi of crimson stars is here!! Either that, or the 25 hundred pyreal cursed ruby that I found on the captain was just another gem.  A level 45 told me thats what the gem was for, so Im pretty sure Im right about this. &lt;I&gt;	-- Magwitch 4/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Iron Golems, Swamp Rats, Zefirs, and Wisps.  You know, all the neat things for an aspiring mage.  &lt;I&gt; -- Gonzo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many dangerous Kefirs who casts Level IV+ Spells and many levers and closed doors. I opened all but didnt find anything interesting. Bad Xp and bad loot. The 2 irons are the only good xp in that dungeon.  &lt;I&gt;	-- StrangerX 12/21/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thisplace has a sacarphagous that spawns al 139 armour!!! 3 item ever26 minutes! Itis SO camped and manipulated! Room at bottom of dungeon, at the last choice of turninng right or left go right (left all before that). Every one who camps is lvl 30+ so havea high quick for beating them cause they cant line up! Sandstone golemn spawns there. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hate Campers! 1/12/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Eh, lets not forget the PK alter at the bottom .. watch out, though, you can trigger a door to open, unleashing many (and I mean many) swamp rats upon you..  Also, Shadows, and more Swamp Rats.. not to mention Swamp Rats... &lt;I&gt;	-- Vioxide 1/18/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The above poster is correct, this is an amazingly good chest. The only problem is that in the last patch, they upeed its defence. Now the chest is gaurded by an iron and obsidian golem, and a level IV lightning trap. Scary for a dungeon with only a level 8 restriction. &lt;I&gt;	-- Togashi Kokuni 2/7/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Correction and Addition...  The lightning traps are lvl III, the chest is now locked, and casts imperil V when you open it.  All the REALLY good loot was in it before the patch too....  it seems to have been lowered a little.  Still good stuff tho &lt;I&gt;	-- Pitt 3/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;chest broken...spawns nothing... tried all day one day :(  &lt;I&gt;	-- George 4/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;chest now requires study iron key &lt;I&gt; 5/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The chest DOES spawn good stuff, you just need one of those stupid Sturdy Iron Keys found randomly on monsters, mostly dires monsters...i found one on a silver rat and one on a Shadow Lt. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sword Nut 6/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As of October patch, Sarcaphagous is now guarded by 2 Obsidian Golems. SIK does NOT open it anymore. &lt;I&gt;	-- Deskjet 10/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Additonal: First off the Stone key does still open the door infront of the now 2 obsids.. which coicidently yield ZERO experience, and are not targetable using radar and creature selection keys.. you must use your mouse thru a texture or edge..   Also the sarcophagus key is found on Lord Rytheran who is still guarding the other (unchanged) sturdy iron chest.  His spawn however is OVER 1 hour long.. we were not patient enough.. only made 1 pull.. got 2-7 +7 attack BD V aluvian only dagger.. not bad for a worthless skill &lt;br&gt;) &lt;I&gt;	-- J.C. - MT 10/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- also as expected this has a quest time.. you have completed this quest to recently.. could not pick up Lord Rytherans Key again 2 hours later. &lt;I&gt;	-- J.C. - MT 10/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To reach Lord Rytheran the Cursed Key from Burial Temple is required..the back door to reach him has been removed in Oct 2000 patch. His key is no-drop and opens Lady Js tomb fka an Uber chest. Loot is still the same variety as when it was Uber chest. Lockpicker and patience required..Lord Rs spawn rate is too long..hope they change this since a group effort is really needed for this quest. See my entry at Burial Temple. Get his letter translated in Zaikhal i believe. BTW, no more campers here =). &lt;I&gt;	-- AllyMcAlchemist 11/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This interesting little tweak they did to the dungean came way to late. The dungean WAS camped but only before the SIK hype calmed down.  Ive made several trips there since then and often the only ones who are there just want to attack the obbies and are glad to help you to the chest.  Making this a non SIK chest ruins it in my opinion and that spawn rate is rediculous.  The chest the last few months seems to have been spitting out items with a higher cash value than actual game function so perhaps Trialos is the place to go now... &lt;I&gt;	-- Rendar 1/7/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Worth a trip just to look! &lt;I&gt; -- Shogo Akai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;its part of the frost quest, at the very bottom is a room with 2 iron golems guarding a book. you can only open the door with the key you get from the madman at the gates of Bandit prison &lt;I&gt;	-- El Shrimpo 12/28/99 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shrimpo was right, the place is really cool looking. Me (17th lvl War) and my Monarch (21st lvl Archer) checked it out. 1st off, for you platemail wearing guys like me, the Ice Gromies blast a nasty breath of zub-zero cold. I took like 14-20 points per blast and a 38 pt critical. Be prepared, not like me standing with an Ice Tachi in hand. Big 0 damage. Down past about 6 of thease and a handful of Rats you come to a deadend room with a large opening in the middle. Lokk down, there is a bridge that you can safely jump too, but be ready for another Ice gromie. One way will go to a deadend with am Ice Golem. Not too tough, less deadly than the Gromies I thought. The other way lead around to another deadend, but with a room to jump down into. 1 or 2 Ice Golems here. There is a deadend hall one way, a set of stairs up the other and a door out. Up the stairs will take you to another bridge and you will see the Lich that was been casting all the spells on you while you were down below. Across the bridge is a locked door. This must be the one you need to have the key from, and there were 2 Iron Golems in there, 42nd level. (shiver) We didnt have the key so we went back down to the other door. Open this and there is a T intersection. If you are around our level, and you go right, you will go right to the lifestone, dont pass go, dont collect 200 pyerels. 42 lvl Iron Golem. Hit me with a spell for 55 pts dmg, and smashed my monarch for over 100, for an instant death. But, if you just haul ass to the left, you will see the exit portal. Good luck,   - Vylarn of Harvestgain &lt;I&gt;	-- Vylarn 1/10/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I did this level as a level 25 war/life/item mage - no real problems.  Just take it slow. At the end, you will be under a rope/wood bridge.  At the top, a Lich was powerless while I drained him.  He didnt spawn for &gt; 10 minutes.  I went to where he stood, in front of the door, and drained the 2 iron golems.  Used the key to go inside and get my loot.  No real problem here.  Cave looked really cool.  Just watch out for ice golems and ivory gromnies. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 3/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you cant Drain or Harm your enemies try this out. When you get to the end of the dungeon, where the 2 irons guard the book, run up to the door after kiling the lich, then slide over to the left of it, 99% of the time one of the irons will come to the door while the other gets stuck on the wall, now you can chop his grimy arse to bits while he throws spell after spell into the dorr (not one came thru after more than 10 kills (for test purposes). Then if u have the key, go on in and take down the other at your leisure. One more thing, the Ivory Groms spit fire NOT ice, and there is one bridge that you shouldnt dilly on as it has a CHILL AIR patch on it and will give you the sniffles. &lt;I&gt;	-- Usagi Rai 5/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;Stop #16 in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. Yes, you still need to make the specialized carrot soup to give to the guy at the Bandit castle. &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 11/16/2003&lt;/i&gt;Cave was upgraded with wasteland rats and ebon gromnies. Fast respawn rate in upper level. See ACMaps for dungeon details. Good experience for the midlevel player who can take on the rats and gromnies with minimal damage. No level restriction, cannot summon, but can recall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Salvage quality runs from 3 - 7 on average. Can make decent money from looting bodies. Made +100k per visit. Playing Lv56 tank axer on WE, made Lv57 in about 3 hours of play time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lifestone tie at Bandit Castle. Short run from there. Again, see www.acmaps.com for complete details of this dungeon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;-- Loki Ironhand 5/28/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Come in from the west, I think. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/30/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The giant Snowman (lvl 126) is still there and sells Snowballs (Poofy and Regular). Stone is  surrounded by Stony/Sandy Arms (or like level monsters). &lt;I&gt;	-- Dunc 3/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alas, I checked today and the giant Snowman had gone. The best way to get here, I think, is to go the North Desert Edge portal near Zaik then head NE. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zloth 5/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hmm, its no longer on a cliff edge, and no longer difficult to approach from any direction. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 11/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

There was one Lich Lord that I saw, but he had several Liches with him.  Bring your fire arrows. &lt;I&gt;	-- Brenna 1/3/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is guarded by a pack of fast-genning skeletons and skeleton warriors, foyer is safe, spawn rate is slow. Dungeon layout is winding but linear, so it will be comforting for those who get lost easily.  Several good wall working spots. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 10/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ummm... I used to hunt this dungeon a lot, and still take vassals there to help them level. Excellent for lvl 10+ to level if theyre not alone. No skeletons, only Zombies, Undead, Lichs, and 1 Lich Lord. Bring a Fire Weapon. &lt;I&gt; -- Dezran Rogue 7/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

I cant see a Cave portal either inside the fort as mentioned regarding the Cave.. &lt;I&gt;	-- TriGaidin 5/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Use the high priests key in the Tumerok Fortress North of Teth (if you cant pick the lock, or jump the wall!) Key has three uses, the High Priest respawns every 20 mins, and is in the far tower, up the stairs, next to the oh-so-worthless chests. &lt;I&gt;	-- Goldhart 6/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Front door is opened with the Heavy Tumerok Key obtained in the Cave at 47.8S, 83.7W. &lt;I&gt;	-- Nodoka 3/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>I didnt go in.  This is what the map dot indicates. &lt;I&gt; -- Curunir&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good dungeon layout. Scalvus are cool looking creatures, but weak for this lvl 34 unarmed - they should be buffed up a lot. A lot of switch pulling in this one. A portal to GW I think is immediately inside. A group of 15-25 level folks should be able to handle this place. Take S.Dires portal near Mayoi to S. Dires, and you are real close - I think. &lt;I&gt;	-- Elder 1/6/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Portal to Riverbend 2.3S, 63.3E &lt;I&gt;	-- Darksilver 1/8/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Went in with lvl 25 Warrior, and 28 Archer. Very cool dungeon, fun, but dangerous. Be aware !!!! after you pull the levers that will open a door, on the upper platform, there will be a series of floor traps that will open and close doors. If you let this main door close b4 you finish this section of the dungeon, you will be trapped. We looked for 3 hours, in about a 6 room area for a lever, button or something to let us out. Wound up commiting suicide and re-entering the dungeon. Maybe we missed something, but would be smart to have 1 member stand outside the door, to run back and reopen it if it closes. We didnt go any farther, as we ran out of time, but i think there is much more to the place. Take 3 people just incase. 1 last thing, when you incounter the little ZEFIRs go for the little Red Bastard 1st. He will hit you rapidly with lvl 3 and 4 spells. A warrior can hack them appart in 2-3 swings, but do it quickly. Good luck. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vylarn -Harvest 3/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a medium-size pull levers dungeon, with many traps on the upper level.  The outside is infested, the foyer is clear.  But, the portal to the surface is at the bottom, not near the entrance.  Upper level is a mix of scalvi and zefirs, bottom pure scalvi.  Gen rate is modest in most areas, fast in a few. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>A very convenient Tower located on the hill above the Tumerok Chamber in the South Dires, not far from where the Mayoi portal drops you off.  To get there, one must go all the way around the base of the mountain till you find a way up, then run all the way back.  Why convenient?  Because there is a Lifestone and Portal to Qalabar at the same spot.  Moreover, a good high-level Dire spawn point is nearby (Golems, Tumeroks, Vorous Shreths, Gold Phyntos Wasps, etc.), within range of the Tower. &lt;I&gt; -- Zuben Pasha&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They moved the spawn point away from the Lifestone and Tower in the latest patch.  Still good hunting nearby. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zuben Pasha 1/22/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This complex is quite hard to reach from below. This mountain has two levels of prehistoric beach around it.  The lower beach is easily accessible from the valley and has the Tumerok Chamber, Lightless Catabombs and peddler on it.  The upper beach has this tower-portal-lifestone complex.  One way to the upper beach is Escalator Slope around the far side of the mountain: 86.6 S, 37.8W for lower beach and 86.4S, 37.6 for upper beach.  Circle the south side beach and its mostly Sandstone Golems. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 2/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

One of the towers had 8-10 Zombies inside jumping down like crazy. DOnt rush in the lagg might get you. Entrance is behind a plant at tower base. Outside just some male/female Tuskers. Run to this place was easy and it could be a great place for low level mages/archers to powerlevel since most of the monsters spawn close to walls. &lt;I&gt; -- Ni Hao 10/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Most of the dungeon is Panumbris shadows... lots and lots of them.  The staff is in an unlocked chest in the last room, guarded by a whole bunch of shadows (panumbris, umbris, paroxysm, and a tenebrous) and a couple of harrower grievvers.  Easily soloable if youre high enough level to resist panumbris spells. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 4/10/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Pretty bad :). &lt;I&gt;	-- rmr11 12/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I found that the lich mage attacks you if you do somehting like portal away without closeing the shop window. MY vassel Rad did this while I was still shoping and I got punched in the face. As of the June update this guy now buys at 60% and sells at 110% just like the Racial Arch Mages. So dont bother unless you just happen to be in the area go to Mayoi. &lt;I&gt; -- Dark Man - Sol 6/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is the center of the crater in the center of the obsidian plains.  The coordinate is approximate, but within 1-2 degrees.  The reason it is not exact will be apparent once you read this. This place is one of the nastiest in all of Dereth.  It is black, save for a forest of tall mushrooms (3x human height), and blue gemstones...  Densely spawned throughout the area are virindi - puppets, servants, and masters...  along with tusker guards and obsidian golems.  In the very center of this crater is a large pink fountain that is surrounded by tusker guards (no less than 20, perhaps as many as 30).  I ran by very quickly so i didnt see the nature of the fountain.  I will explore it again and add more later, or hope that someone else has discovered its secret and will add to my tale. &lt;I&gt; -- Ryukyu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is about 5 - 10 mins away from the HOLL. You know you getting close when the mountains all turn black. Im only a level 30 fighter. I ran up to the fountain and ran out even quicker. Scariest place Ive seen so far. If you want a massive challenge go for it. &lt;I&gt;	-- Toekiller 1/13/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Seeing your post I went there out of sheer curiosity. No joking about 100 virindi, 10-20 wisps, 5-10 Obsidian Golems, and 20-30 tuskers all concentrated in a about a 1 kilometer radius. I scanned through for inanimate objects, found nothing. I ran through the fountain and also nothing. However I never hit fountain dead on virindi were controlling my movements more than my keyboard I was bouncing off em. &lt;I&gt;	-- fyre 1/18/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fountain restores health, much like a mana pool in the meeting halls.   &lt;I&gt;	-- The Mad Jester  12/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I finally got here and felt a little dissappointment.  Not nearly as hard as the above description lead me to believe.  I found only typical Obsidian Plains spawns.  But it is still a must see area. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khaos 2/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It now drains mana and health. Not nearly as packed as it used to be. You stagger as 3 points of mana are drained by the mysterious crystal!. The crawling energies drain 5 points of your health! &lt;I&gt; -- Krell (LC) 7/2/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>You can get easy to this tower near Mayoi. Just walk of the right-side of Mayoi-beach, till it makes a corner to the right. By that corner, walk up the hill, and then you will see this tower. There could be some golems and shallows round it and maybe even some zefirs. In the tower is a granite golem (lvl 32). Its REALLY though. It hit me for 67 health points once, it has very strong magic, so look out!! Greetings, Xaja &lt;I&gt; -- Xaja&lt;/i&gt;</description>

No treasures that i could see &lt;I&gt;	-- GeorgeKG 12/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is about as remote as anything in Dereth.  No portals, so you must run in.  The run is Loooong and dangerous.  And frankly, you can fight the creatures in this town at a dozen different locations easier to reach than this.  Yjr lifestone at the river valley appears to be nearby on the map, but it is actually quiet far since you have only one route through the mountains.  In my opinion there is no reason to come here.   &lt;I&gt;	-- JANN 3/29/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1 Undead, 1 Skeleton Warrior, 2 Liches.

    <description>A cute little white bunny rabbit in a bunker, Pookie, per the AC Devs.  It is Level 666 and breathes lightning.. run away .. run away! DO NOT ID IT, or it will attack you.  Area is populated with high level monsters. At certain times of the year, there may be two level 230 white rabbit babies spawning here too.   The white rabbit does piercing and lightning melee damage and has a 1 hit magic life drain move called Bunny Smite that is almost always fatal.  It is very fast, and quite deadly.  Debuffing it will cause it to counter buff.  Overwhelming it with rending weapons can work well, although that takes a larger group.  There are various ideas about the right strategy to use with this creature.  When it is defeated, it Smites the one who did the most damage, usually fatal.  It drops an Orb of the Bunny Booty, no drop, no give.  It also has a givable carcass.  You can use 2 of these to create white rabbit slippers.  Hand one in to William Witty in Lytelthorpe, and then combine what he gives you with your other white rabbit carcass.  Respawn time is about 15 minutes.&lt;I&gt;  -- Rick O Shay -- Arkayas -- Polecat -- Nightwolf -- Some Guy -- Garfield Bond -- Luci X -- Tak -- BURNED -- Life and Death -- Taarna Blood SC &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ahhh and more info, it will kill you in maximum 2 hits, it uses a hollow lightning attack for melee and Bunny Smite spell (drains 1-4000 health, I saw one person only get 200 health drained). The way to kill it:  Make a wall of melees to just surround the entrance, make archers behind them to shoot it, and behind that mages with 400 buffed creature/life skills. Have them Yield it, then vuln 7 then imp 7 IT WILL SMITE THEM! Have at least 3 mages because the bunny may smite 2. The bunny will try to get to the mages who vulned/impd him so make sure you kill it quick before it kills the person who vulned it. After that it will kill melees and youll have a corpse for it to eat. So, yield, vuln, imp while the melees block it from getting to the mages/archers. Then archers unload on it fire damage. Boom hes dead, not too hard just have some high level melees/archers/mages  and use this method. Ahh yes, and dont ID the sucker or he will attack you, up till then hes peaceful, and the rock isnt safe, he will smite you AND jump on it .  &lt;I&gt; -- Stay puff of MT 7/13/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Dungeon in a partial fort on the path between Fort Tet and the North Direlands entrance. This was a run-by so details are sketchy.  Outside is rich, there are Skeleton Lords, Tumerocs, Shadows and Iron Golems.  No details on portal or on inside.   &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The name of this place is Tumerok Base &lt;I&gt;	-- Shoto Fle-Alch 2/10/00 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon is full of tumeroks.  Mostly warriors, gladiators, and priests.  1 high tumerk and 1 high priest at the end.  This dungeon is a long windy one way type of deal.  You have to lockpick 5 or 6 doors.  At the very end of the dungeon are 2 chests which spawn crappy loot.  Dont come to this dungeon tumeroks are not worth it nor is the loot. &lt;I&gt;	-- Moe 2/10/00 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is where the Drunken Madmans Gateway drops you off. An Arena like fort with two portals and stairs along the outside.  Some creatures along the outside of the wall. &lt;I&gt; -- -Grasp SC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Feel exceptionally brave?  From the walled portal take the outside accursed halls poratal.  Climb the wall here and jump off and be prepared for some really good hunting.  Run to original fort (21.5, 74.8w).  The general radius of the first tower can get real hairy, especially the swarms of gold wasps.  If you can, try to lure out the gold wasps one by one so that you dont have 3 or more chasing you while you run and most likely run into more tail.  But once you get to the other fort (yeah I know a long run W) it will all be worth.  Really good hunting here.  Ravenors, Stalkers, numerous Copper Golems and the occasional fragments.  I did this run at lvl 25, make sure you got high arse run and high arse life. ---Shiroi Okami no Kage, of Thistledown--- &lt;I&gt;	-- Hairy Kamikaze 5/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a respectable wall working spot for mages.  And, if your jump is good, a respectable archery and melee spot as well because there are stairs on the outside that lead up to the wall top. But watch out! Monsters can use these stairs as redily as heros, and from the top they will jump inside.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 3/5/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Home of the Tumerok Overlord and his uber chest.  High lockpick is almost essential here.  This dungeon portal is in the tower of the huge, heavily populated Tumerok Fortress.  Level 20+, tieable, but not summonable.  You can sneak around the back and tie to the portal without having to go in the fort.  You can then portal recall inside.  If you wish to save your tie, you can pick the entry door on the South side, the resistance is 650.  There is also a key for this door, and keys for all the other doors in the dungeon.  See the writeup at Maggie the Jackcats site for more details.  After running around the dungeon a bit, you come to an octagonal room with blue gemstones.  In the south wall near 2 blue gemstone pillars there is a secret passage to the final diff 700 locked door to the Overlords chamber.   The Overlord is guarded by Virindi Preceptors and a few Tumeroks.   He has a lightning Overlords quest sword that is no drop, and a no drop key to his chest.  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood  -- Anon  -- Zimbalt/Hirachi -- Taarna Blood SC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; He drops a key (1 week timer) for his chest which has 20-60 sing-quality items in it (good chance at something decent). Ive done this quest many times throughout the years, it does not require lockpick. There is a long quest for the keys, but they are not required either. The route is much longer without lockpick, but its doable. &lt;I&gt;-- Driden of Frostfell 11/5/2003&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come and see the happy Tumerok Champions, as they jump on your head from above. Come see the Augmented Tumeroks, and Ascendants, who are always delighted to show off their magic. Come and have your toes nibbled by half a dozen Wasteland Rats. Come and unlock those locked doors and the Overlords Chest.  Come and visit the imprisoned monsters and a bizarre floor full of mushrooms. Surrounded by about a dozen ever-friendly Virindi Preceptors is a Tumerok Overlord, who will be happy to slap you about a bit after youve been turned into a quivering wreck of weakness, frailty and slowness by his hooded companions.&lt;I&gt;-- Goldhart&lt;/i&gt;</description>

If youve got an army looking for something to do, bring it here. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inside it is easy to get overpowered by the Tumerok Officers, Gladiators, and High Tumeroks.

    <description>Looks like the entrance to Thasali Dungeon (a short way north), but its not.  Its an entrance with no portal, but full of eight or so skeletons which spawn only after you come in.  Look for a portal on your radar, if theres no portal, its this ambush place. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I walked in and the whole floor stood up!!  Two skels, two skel warriors, and a skel captian.  Chest seems to have less than the Captain. &lt;I&gt;	-- Tesslah 4/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Run in front of the steps to the meeting hall and then quickly dart around the corner.  If done right, the monster will run up the steps to the meeting hall and get stuck.  You are then free to cast spells and fire missiles at the helpless creature all you want.  Be careful not to fire when they are running away from your position, because you will overshoot them.  Best place to fire is between the pillar and the wall of the hall.  Havent tried to get one in the actual portal room yet.  I think they might not be able to actually go into the portal room at all! &lt;I&gt;	-- Regis 4/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good staging spot for mud/water golem hunting, but watch for shadow children.

Current theory holds that the Span was rendered invisible by the Emperyans in a futile attempt to hold back the Olthoi invasion, since Olthoi are known to fear open water. &lt;I&gt;	-- Necron 3/24/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Aluvian stone (ice) and book that needs translation. Several Ice Golems and Etherial Wisps guard the igloo. Random mattekar and monouga spawns nearby. On the run from Holtburg I must have slain 50 or so wood golems and not a single mote. &lt;I&gt; -- Elric Kinslayer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Location of Minor Shivering Stone. Guarded by Ethereal Wisps and Ice Golems. -- Ignatius Loyola &lt;I&gt; 3/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No Ice Golems in sight, but the Ethereal Wisps were there. These Wisps may be level 5, but they tend to use drain health.  Be careful. My gfx card is maxd out on settings and I run in 1280x1024.  When I walked inside, the smoke and steam caused my PC to lag.  No monsters in sight. Relatively easy, but the run here can take forever.... &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 4/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;YOu do not need to fight the wisp to get the gem and book. Simply run by or shoot at ice golems to draw them away from igloo. Then kill the ice golem and walk right past the wisps. The wisp wont attack you unless they are attacked or are near when you attack the ice golems. &lt;I&gt;	-- porkmaster 4/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You Dont even need to fight the golems just run right into the igloo and you will not have to fight anything the golems cant get you from there, and after awhile they see you as no threat and they go back to resting &lt;I&gt;	-- DV 6/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Near the exit of the Slaughter House portal in South Direlands.  This is the Slaughter House.  A large Tumerok fort with a single tower. High Tumerok in the tower, three or four priests on the grounds, numerous others, lots and lots of cows and auroch cattle inside, too.  Lurkers and stalkers outside to the north and reenforcement tumeroks in the low walled building to the south.  Approach from the east.  Gate is locked, get a key from one of the Tumeroks in the tower next to the Slaughter House portal, or pick it... takes good, but not superb, pickskill (base 100 plus buffs and lock weakens).  Good hunting if you can handle the spawn pace.  Fort Tethana is a reasonable run due east.&lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Due to some strange spawning bug in the March update this area is now BLANKETED with gold wasps. There is a wasp right next to where the portal drop you so be prepare to fight or flight as soon as your feet hit the ground.

    <description>Huge place, when you first enter you are in a small room and hall, from here you must jump down to 3 lich lords(I left).  No exit so portal out, die, or fight lich lords. Looks to be part of the March Quest, since I had never seen it before, and the huge room which you must jump into is snowwing so I presume it is the snow portion of the quest. &lt;I&gt; -- Kamaitachi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont jump down. Jump across to the ledge.  If you look hard, you will see it over on your right when facing the first pit. &lt;I&gt;	-- Heysun 2/24/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not just lich lords.  Many revenants and dark revenants around as well, all casting level IV+ debuffs and indirect attacks.  Exit portal is guarded by at least 4 creatures, at least one of which is a Dark Revenant. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hiro 2/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Home of the Major Shivering Stone. &lt;I&gt;	-- Hazridi 3/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beware of the spawn rate also. Just at the entrance there can be up to 4-6 Lich Lords and 2 Revenents. I accidentally went here and had some friends try to get me out. I lev 26 War, Monarch Lvl 30 Archer, Lev 33 Mage and lev 43, War. We couldnt kill them fast enough. All but the 43rd Warrior died, and only because he had lifestone recall. At the end we all made a mad dash to try to find an exit. At 1 time i had no less than 15 Lich Lords and Revs on my radar. *shiver* Last time i enter a dungeon b4 i have inof about it. Careful and GL &lt;I&gt;	-- Vylarn  H-gain 3/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For those of you who got the Major Stone before the patch (like i did. =D ) your lucky. Now make sure you are buffed up and ready for some serious fightin! Now you arent put in the hall but youre dropped right in the pit to start. fun Fun. :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Xzeno 4/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good place to camp dark revenants for thighbones.. only other choice is nexus as far as I know and more people came there :) &lt;I&gt;	-- mengar 6/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OK.. Heres a shortcut but you need at least a 270 jump skill. Enter the dungeon and clear the 1st room. Right in front of you when you enter is a passage with a torch above it and a large rock just in front of it to the right. Jump on top of the rock, use shift+jump to jump on top of the torch, turn 180 degrees and jump up to the ledge, follow the ledge back towards the torch, you will come to a pit. Jump diagonal to your left to the large ledge, there is a door there that leads to the end and the Major Stone. Good Luck.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Crunchyfrog 9/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I did it with 250 jump, not 270 &lt;I&gt;	-- Fullcrum 11/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I did it with a 223 jump skill. &lt;I&gt; -- Dezran Rogue 7/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quite easy to complete.  80% of the time its got macroers or someone hunting the Revenants in there, and if you use the jump shortcut, you can complete this quest without firing one arrow, spell, or swinging the sword. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Right next to the stone you can find the Elaborated Scroll wich later translates at Cragstone translator to the Imperial Missive. David ibn Jensen &lt;I&gt; -- David ibn Jense 1/20/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance and Exit are quiet. Portals can be tied to and Recalled, but not summoned. The foyer is hot, covered by three Lich Lords and a Revenant.  The only exit portal is at the far end of the dungeon near the Stinging Stone Room. Following a right hand rule will take you through some heavy fighting to a jump into a large, long room. At the far end of the room is the hall leads to the second floor, and ultimately to the Major Stining Stone.  Following left hand rule will take you to a quieter section of the dungeon on the first level, and some dead end routes to the second floor. Dungeon is fast spawn with Lich Lords, Revenants and Dark Revenents. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/7/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Correction: Shivering Stone, not Stinging Stone. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/7/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is part of Marchs Quest. It is where you find the Major Searing Stone for use in the new Pyreal Weapons. It is filled with Olthoi Soldiers. No workers at all. Watch out for the acid, as it burned me for 96 a few times! The stone is near the Surface Portal at the end of the dungeon behind a few Soldiers. Good luck! &lt;I&gt; -- Noah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I found this by accident on 2/17/00  if you question this claim then ask aliera &lt;I&gt;	-- Atal 2/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The portal cannot be tied to.  The foyer and the outside are both richly populated, so come prepared for non-stop trouble. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 5/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is really not that hard with the right group and acid &amp; pierce protects. I did it with a group of 15 people levels 30-70. Only two were life mages. If you can survive the Olthoi Hordes Nest solo or with one other person, you should be ok here.-- &lt;I&gt;	-- Flowing Dragon 10/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;TIt is suggested to tie at swamp temple in the dires and then run to Incubala Vault.  Also there is a very nice perch spot for you archers out there, u need at least 250 jump to get on the perch and it is located near the middle of the Vault.  I went there by myself but since im an acher with 210 melee D they kicked my ass bad, so i suggest u go wwith a group of between 2-5 to get thru the olthoi onto the perch spot. &lt;I&gt;	-- Darks Lord 1/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One note about the archer perch...heavily camped, and bickering goes on there quite a bit. I would have to say in order of population, this is tougher than OHN by far, especially when you go into the large rooms, Olthoi come out from 8 directions. Great fun though...if you live. &lt;I&gt;	-- Punisher Zod 1/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The perches were removed, as per the August 2001 patch.  Tread carefully. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good. Now if they just took life magic and bows out we might actually have a game going here. &lt;I&gt; -- Sega slayer 12/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Inside of the Four Towers. Restricted to lvl20+. May be part of the March quest (as it is new to the Towers). Four Towers Entrance portal still broken (restricted to lvl 5-15) as of this entry. &lt;I&gt; -- Dunc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Contains no less then 5 Undead priests, who are level 41.  Also found here a broken staff No idea as to its use &lt;I&gt;	-- Daffyd 2/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Broken staff is part of Impious Staff quest.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Sol-Noir 3/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;See the 4 towers dungeon notes I entered for more details &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 3/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mostly Skeletons throughout much of the dungeon. Early parts of the dungeon are divided into 4 main sectors, 3 of the sectors containing a Skeleton Warrior behind a door with a key youll need later in the dungeon, and one section having a Skeleton Captain. Undead protect the wonderous Naqibs Journal giving you a total of 100 pages at the bruden of some 120! (or some other really low weight, better than buying a book.) You encounter the Undead Priests in the hall and room preceeding the doors you need to use your 4 keys (gathered earlier in the dungeon.) Bring lightning protection. Broken Staff itself is givable, the item has a timer on it so you cant pick it up again quickly (or maybe you can only pick it up once.) Final product is Gharundim. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield3d 6/24/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The comment about Dizah ibn Nadqabs journal not only has the name wrong, it is just plain WRONG. 11 pages, all full, nothing at all wondrous about it. YOu and your buddies can take turns reading it while you wait for the high priest to respawn. &lt;I&gt; 7/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

If you have a respectable rn skill, they wont wake up in time anyway. &lt;I&gt; -- CyndalT 5/7/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Cave with many Flames and Flares, contains the Minor Smoldering Stone, the Gharundim elemntal sourcestone.  Spawns once an hour. &lt;I&gt; -- Aris&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Parchment w/msg from Asheron spawns right after stone - msg is in high Empyrean and must be translated &lt;I&gt;	-- Cordt 2/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Life mages have this one made.  Just drain the Flares safely from above.  There were about 5.  As soon as you hit one, he darts around very fast.  If you are not in front of the entrance, you should be ok. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 4/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To clear up some possible confusion, there are three columns of fire that pulsate in front of the entrance.  There are no Flammas here. Good idea to visit the Swamp Cave after leaving here.  It is not too far away. Just be prepared... &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 4/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The Minor Stinging Stone for the Atlan weapons.  Guarded by Mosswarts Shamans and lots of Swamp Rats.  South of Yanshi, west of Sawato, as per the rumor. &lt;I&gt; -- Junko&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I dont know if it was like this when Junko was there, but I have never seen such a dense population of any monsters anywhere other than here. You attack a Mosswart, about 75 more come to help their bro.  Rats are not as bad.  Be buffed, stay alive, prepare for a lot of lag.  Radar had more orange than black - seriously! I used one Mosswart as a ladder to jump on top of the bunker.  This took melee out of the picture.  Drained the Shaman and rats one at a time.  Took about 20 minutes to clear the place out. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 4/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good idea to visit the Fire Cave after leaving here.  It is not too far away and is much easier than here. &lt;I&gt;	-- Vincent Price 4/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a one-room bunker.  About 15 Desert Rats are packed inside, and the Minor Stinging Stone is on the ground at the back.  If you want a small fight, you can wall work the rats from up top and well behind the entrance without exciting the mosswarts, then do a run in and grab. (June patch) &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All I can say is easy Quest there was nothing here maybe someone already killed them but that cant be true, cause 10min after i arrived the stone appeared and also a note???? Thats a secret. REGULATORS!!!!!!!! &lt;I&gt;	-- NikoliTheSavoir 8/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You dont even need to fight all the mosswarts inside. Just drian all the rats, then run in and attack the shaman from INSIDE and when all the other mosswarts come they cant get into the bunker. You can safely portal out or wait for them to leave then run off :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Nexic 11/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

White and Snowy Mattekars, a Spikey Dillo, and a Laigas Lugian stand guard to the east of the buildings. Wood Golems can be found a little further to the southeast. &lt;I&gt; -- Minas Tirith&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This spot appears to broken.  :(  The only monsters that spawn there now, as of 01/14/02, appear to be a Liagus Lugian + Amploth, one Barker Mossie in the western most bunker, and a random spawn farther to the west still on the little hill of Wood Golems and Jade Gromnie.  Reedsharks may occasionally spawn next to the lugians guarding the tower. &lt;I&gt; -- Dazar Tae--DT 1/14/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is an emperyian power station-style building.  This place has Pandemonium and Sinister Shadows, half the shadows spawn inside, half outside. Inside is a note- &lt;BR&gt; Im not afraid to say it: Black Ferah is a fool. Assaulting a tomb to steal a relic? Even if this Anadil struck down one of the blessed Hopeslayers Thorns, the creature is dead. Despoiling its tomb does nothing to further our cause and right the ancient wrongs committed against us. And dont you sense the meddling of those cloaked creatures? Why do we waste our time on this pointless raid? Worse yet, we only retrieved a portion of the creatures staff and lost many our breathen in the process. If Black Ferah wants the piece, tell her to come get it, if she can tear herself away from her constant vigil by where the Hopeslayer fell. We are keeping it at the temporary staging ground at 82.3S, 35.2W Signed as unknown. &lt;I&gt; -- Rufen -- Doc Feelgood -- Chrono Crest &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>North Direlands dungeon restricted to lvl 15 and upper. Lots of granite, copper and iron golems. Beware, access to that place can be dangerous ! there are often gold wasps, silver rats and other nasty creatures at the entrance and waiting for you to take one of the two exit portal... Nearby lifestone at , near Mountain Halls. &lt;I&gt; -- Shimroar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two main sections of the dungeon.  Upper parts has lots of granite golems, while the lower part is all iron and copper.  LOTS of people now.  Many people come in with acid weapons to hunt the irons and copper and cant take the golems.  Watch out.  They often lead a group of golems right to you when you are healing or something.  Great place when no one is there... but always crowded nowadays :( &lt;I&gt;	-- Soze 4/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I meant some people cant take the granites &lt;I&gt;	-- Soze 4/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;The golems have all been replaced with Gold Golems. This is stop #19 in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 11/16/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Some kind of eldritch UFO has landed just outside Khayyaban.  Its over ten stories tall, and it has carved a huge crater.  It hums, it scintillates, its a huge Vegas style billboard for something... but what that is I dont know yet. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Shadow Spire has disappeared.  The blackened crater is still present and there are some coloured particles in the air at the bottom of the crater. &lt;I&gt;	-- Maglor Daefalas 8/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Location of (IMO) the easiest to use PK alter.  1 young banderling and 2 captains are all you have to go through to get to the alter.  To get there to the portal give the drink to the madman near bashi, and he will portal you to an enclosed area with a *direlands* shreth (actually halfway difficult if you arent expecting it).  Then another portal and youre at the staging area. The dungeon has a vendor where you spawn in, and I found the PK alter in 5 minutes despite my poor navigation skills.  The dungeon is *very* well designed, has a real nice feel to it.  Go for the architecture if nothing else. &lt;I&gt; -- machina&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For the Drunken Madman, you have to give him sake to make the portal open... as well, the Vorous shreth is not always there, in fact there is usually no enemies when you get to the dires, inside the Walled Portals &lt;I&gt;	-- Daffyd 3/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If there are critters inside they came over the ladders outside. Usually drawn in by the wussy life mages who stodd in the wrong place. They usually bail out of one of the portals when they make this mistake.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Gurth 5/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May not be a decent way of getting xp (us warriors hate it), but the walls are very populated with archers, as well as life mages draining, cheap and fast way to get xp. &lt;I&gt;	-- Skorn 5/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is safe, foyer is safe.  Portals cannot be tied to.  Design is early school with a very lived in feel.  The gen rate is liesurly&lt;br&gt; the winding corridors lead to rooms, and the rooms have monsters in them.  Good wall working opportunities. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 3/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Sclavus bunker with a dungeon in E Dires. Level 15+ &lt;I&gt; -- Alun Magus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The key to this place (a hideous key) can be found in the other Swamp Temple, the one not in the Dires.  The highest level creature here is level 40, with sprinklings of lower fare, and swamp grommies.  Some chests which seemed empty, except one which spawned several 1000p valued items. &lt;I&gt;	-- Goldhart 4/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sturdy iron key opens chest at bottom &lt;I&gt;	-- Shoto Fle-Alch 5/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The key to get in here is a Grotesque one, and as noted above, is in the swamp temple near Sawato. Creatures in here are nearly all Sclavi--Se, Aste, Essa, and lots of Sata in the bottom. Bring your Superior Helm, because they throw Defenselessness 3 and Vulnerability 3 like theyre going out of style--expect your melee and missile defense to be 20 points lower from the time you walk in the door. They also like acid 3, frost 3, and shock 3. They drop wands, staves, and orbs like theyre going out of style, so if you need vassal magic gear, this is a good place to go. Also used as a staging area for the Incunbala Vault, which is north and west of here. &lt;I&gt;	-- Aliciana 5/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The outside is infested, the foyer is clear.  This is a large early era dungeon with rambling corridors, large halls, and modest monster density and gen rates. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Entrance and exit are hot with local Dires Fauna, and, in fact, this is a good portal pop hunting place. Foyer is quiet -- no action until you jump across the pit. Revs, Dark Revs up top in a cluster of small rooms (nice wall working) and Shadow family on level below. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 5/19/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beyond the Revenant Rooms, the dungeon fills with Shadows. It becomes quite symmetric and leads you down though a series of three pits that you must jump into to continue.  The bottom of each pit is lightning trapped and guarded by a half-dozen or so shadows ranging from Lts to Umbris.  The BDT room is filled with Nexus fragments -- which dont seem to drop anything very often, if ever.  There is a portal to the surface after a long climb on the far side of the Fragment Room. Spawn rate in the lower levels is slow. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/7/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Try examining the building a bit more closely...the golems are on a 15 minute spawn cycle so you have time. =) &lt;I&gt;	-- Khrome-Khoran 1/17/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Um I don’t know what you are talking about, but you DO need a lock picker.

Shadows and wasps come and go, as do lots and lots of heros. There are archer rocks near the north and south edges, and the Ft.

    <description>These hills are badlands.  They are not high, but the slopes are steep.  The trails through are torturous with many dead ends -- valley trails and crest trails can both end abruptly.  Plan your routes through here carefully.  The signatures extend from roughly 30S on the north to 45S on the south and 54W on the east to 71W on the west. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now known as the Valley of Death as of the Jan 2003 patch, this entire area is filled with the most god-awfully overpowered monsters in the game.  Drudge Seraphs, Bile Grievvers, and Tusker Obliterators are just a few of the high-octane, high-HP critters infesting this area&lt;br&gt; also sighted is the fabled Tremendous Monouga with 2 million HP.  This is THE playground of the elite: come with a large group of level 80+ characters and watch the massive XP roll in like never before. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 1/27/2003 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also known as Skull Valley, another appropriate choice. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/28/2003 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>A secluded underground crypt in the Dire valleys. From what I could glean at a distance, it contains many Mu-miyahs (Lesser, Greater, and even lvl 42 Horrible), and a chest or two. I couldnt get inside for a closer look because a group of Panumbris chased me off... :/ &lt;I&gt; -- Lorelai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As reported, but in fact there are two underground bunkers, think the horrible Mu-miyah is level 40.  They cast feeble magic, and the entire lot can be cleared in five minutes.  Chests are all empty, possibly bugged like all the others.  Another worthless place that doesnt belong in the Dires.  Most of the critters are around level 11.  This place should have been filled with level 40s and up, otherwise why put it in the Dires? &lt;I&gt;	-- Goldhart 5/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is where the other half of the Staff of the Nomads now lies.  Its in an unlocked chest in the larger of the two bunkers, guarded by lots of high level Mu-Miyahs: Guardians, Imperials, Nomads, and two Royals. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 4/10/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Coords are approximate.  Various nasties near entrance portal (usually Iron golems).  3 Tusker Slaves spawn in entry room of dungeon.  Of course, lots of virindi farther in.  Didnt go very far as I was alone.  Portal in entrance room leads back to the surface portal.   &lt;I&gt; -- Arioc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Its 4 tuskers in the entrance room. In the final room some mediocre (around 5k items) floor spawn. when u make the jump be prepared to take about 20 dmg and get swarmed by a dozen puppets..not really worth the trouble tho&lt;I&gt;	-- Heart Failure 4/28/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One of the doors going further in, up the stairs can be opened by the switch upstairs, go left facing the exit portal, open the door by using [key R] the side lever, and push the lever inside.  You also need to control the levers on the ground floor, and then will be able to get further in the complex.  Down some stairs, a brief respite as the tuskers and virindi are behind a closed door.  Open the door, using a lever, and you are in another area with a couple of tuskers, and virindi.  Another pointless empty chest, and an upstairs path that leads to switches to open an exit portal, and a door that leads to the final area.  I would not recommend jumping down, as there is little hiding place from a dozen virindi puppets and fairy things, but an exit is placed there, back to the surface. &lt;I&gt;	-- Goldhart 5/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well what can I say about this place...A great drain spot for lifers...But heed my warning If you see Krow or Ryucho zen in the harvest gain world and myself...get out I will never stop trying to kill them and I dont care who gets in my way... &lt;I&gt;	-- Krack of HG 9/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Goldhart, I would like to note, that your post above is a complete waste of text, and should be deleted. &lt;I&gt; -- Fairy GodMother 7/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Very tall spire with more undead than a George Romero movie: Liches, Lich Lords, Revenants take your pick.  Probably about 10-15 total.  They spawn on the spire but will jump down onto you if you get close (read massive impact damage).  Lot of traffic through this area headed to the Virindi Fort, so usually all the liches end up huddled around the base of the spire waiting to bum rush you if you attack or get close.  The spire itself basically has a wraparound path leading up to the top where there are two chests with ... drumroll please ... nothing in them!  Usually Ob golems and high level drudges around spire as well.  Unless you like lich xp and loot, skip this place and head over to the Virindi fort. &lt;I&gt; -- Arioc&lt;/i&gt;</description>

The rats can jump up and bite your toes through the ceiling! &lt;groan&gt; Treasure is high quality food (Auroch healing meat, fresh fish). &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;Cave is now populated by 4 Banderling Aggressors and 2 Savages guarding a runed chest. &lt;I&gt;-- Jungle Souljah 7/29/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>A small cave with 4 outcast monougas.  When you come back out, youll be near Cragstone. &lt;I&gt; -- Xyblea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The exit does NOT drop you near Cragstone but at 18.4E, 62.1E. It shares this destination with the cave closest too the drop point. Perhaps a usefull way for a burdened warrior to make it back to Eastham but little else. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sundoro Taal 6/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt; This is actually the same dungeon as the one to the east of here, I tested by dropping a gem in this one and going into the other one, lo and behold, the gem was there. It simply has two entrances, one exit. A truly pointless dungeon in any case. &lt;I&gt;-- Halcyon 9/12/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Lugians galore.  Everything from Lithos to Laigus. About 8-10 lugians with a couple of limestone golems nearby.  Approach the fort from the south, and you can hide behind the south wall until they run out of rocks. Lifestone and peddler and healer to the west.  Banderlings, mossworts, and reedsharks in the surrounding hills.  Mattekars (great, snowy, and white) in the mountains to the south.  Good place for melee fighters from their upper teens to mid twenties. &lt;I&gt; -- Minas Tirith&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bigger Lugians now (Gigas and Extas) and the Dread Mattekar can be found here.  Spawn cycle is about 5 minutes. &lt;I&gt; -- Tanu (MT) 4/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Location of the Commander and LTs for the Blade of the heart, used for the Spear of Purity &lt;I&gt; -- Korgan (DT) 5/22/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Lugian Commander drops the lugian paduons, used to get the helm of craig.  There is LS at 67.3S 28.3E, pretty good place for level 30+.  Lugian Titus raiders with hollow weapons spawn when the lugian commander at the 2nd camp is killed. &lt;I&gt; -- BuffDaddy -MT 8/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Ka Ku-To can be found near these three windmills up on the Plateau.  Ka Ku-To sells the key that opens the Inner Dungeon Doors.  (Also sells nice plate armor.)  Area has a few level 15 flames - fire elementals - bring your fire protection! &lt;I&gt; -- Blayd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fire elementals are confirmed as flares. Also some Tiofor Ursuin near the windmills as well, but I believe the flares are more permanent. The key for the inner dungeon costs 290p, and Ka Ku-To does take trade notes. &lt;I&gt;	-- Duryn 11/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Theres a portal to Samsur in the Grievous Vault. after the first drop, turn right and head down the corridor to a crossroads. The room to the left is empty except for assorted furnishings, an altar, and a flame trap. However, there are fake walls: one on wall paralleling the Altar and to its left (which leads to a bunch more traps in a small room with an empty chest), and another fake wall just right of the altar. This second one leads directly to the portal, no traps. I put it on the map and not in the vault section so that the Shortest Path part of Explorer will take advantage of it. Exit  &lt;I&gt; -- Orome&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The triple-trapped chest hidden in the altar room has good loot! It is NOT empty!

    <description>Found by my buddy Joeis Mage, who was running ahead of me:-)..2 tusker slaves near portal entrance detered us from exploring further as we both had vitaes &lt;I&gt; -- Karasawa Yukio&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hmm, strange, so maybe there are two? I was in the dungeon at . Tusker slaves on first level, guards starting from level below. Nice place &lt;I&gt;	-- Sargoth of OIF 6/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the june patch, it seems they have added multiple entrances(two) to each major dungeon...  &lt;I&gt;	-- Shugyosha 6/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Three. &lt;I&gt;	-- Mengar 6/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is solid tuskers. The top level is all slaves but the levels below it are guards. Awesome XP. Id suggest travelling with a group or else youll get overwhelmed very easily. &lt;I&gt;	-- Flake 6/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dangerous place for the unprepared.  Exellent xp if you can handle the respawn rate.  Dont count on fighting individual Tuskers&lt;br&gt; expect at least 3 or 4 to attack you at once, usually more.  One way tie to portal&lt;br&gt; you can only tie from outside so that you appear inside, and if someones dragged a score of Tuskers to the entrance and youre not buffed, then be ready for the LS :).  Ive never managed to hit the very bottom, but have made it to the third level down before our party of six was reduced to two through deaths or playing the chicken :)  Encountered Slaves on first level with the odd Guard, all Guards on levels below plus a Virindi (sp?) Servant in the main hall on the second level.  If anyones gone further then let us know whats down there :)  Massive value of loot just lying around the place because most come here just for the xp&lt;br&gt; however quality of loot is terrible unless youre after colour co-ordinated armour.  Huge lag here,  but that might just be my connection (I play from the UK).  Expect to see a lot of people here during peak times.  Be ready with the curses when that Tusker youre tanking starts being drained by some level 20 Mage who runs as soon as a Tusker turns on him :).  Average level of player Ive seen here is 38. &lt;I&gt;	-- Laz al-Farah 6/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are two ramps that go down. I have only taken the one to the right, and at the bottom of that once you go down the hallway, and if your solo youll die, there is a room with an uber chest 2 virindi masters, and i think 3 or 4 guards. Safest thing is to back into a corner when in trouble if your a mage, and just start imperiling the tuskers. Once imperiled the archers and meleers jump on em.  Great xp for a lvl 40ish archer fellowed with the same lvl life mage. &lt;I&gt;	-- Theneler ( TD ) 6/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lamest, the most idiotic dungeon of Dereth. Really efficient ruining of gaining levels with effort. Little over 30s mages running around at peak hours draining Slaves to 1/4 and then portal recall and same again. Most people dont even bother to finish off the tuskers at all - just waiting to someone else to get their attention. This dungeon is making more selfish and idiotic powerlevelers to Dereth.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Finkish 6/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rooms are big, hallways are wide, the tuskers move about easily, and wall working is hard.  Life mages have compensated by innovating a gang work technique instead, and have prospered.  (It is nice that this game can be played in many ways.) &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 7/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The left down ramp leads to a Servant and then several large areas with lots of guards.  Following this a ways youll get to a big hall with alcoves on the sides of it, with tuskers in.  At the end of this hall is another ramp down with about 12 Drudge Ravs and Stalkers, and a couple of Virindi.  Theres a chest in the room with the drudges (uber I guess).  Two locked doors after this, followed by a long hallway up and an exit portal.  Why would a mage drain a slave to 1/4 and then portal out?  Who kills the tuskers then?  I never see anyone draining for 2/3 or 3/4 and running -- people kill what theyre fighting... oh well.  Sorry your experience isnt better Finkish... =( &lt;I&gt;	-- Chen Kenichi 9/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BSD Ayan Baqur on DarkTide was nerfed, down to 8 tusker spawn near the uberchest, still alright hunting on a 7 minute spawn... &lt;I&gt;	-- -PsychoStarfire 10/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The XP is good...if you can get it.  Three words best describes this place...TOO MANY MAGES! I spent too much time trying to find my own kills.  In the end I gave up and began kill stealing, its the only way to get the good XP everyone talks about.  My level 52 guy can easily take these tuskers on, but its a real fight trying to keep your kills.  Its no better than Qualabar Citadel and the lag is even worse (at least at the Teth BSD it is).  Mages are only after the tuskers and will flee when confronted by high level drudges and virindi. Back to OHN or Lugian Excavation for me.  Loot is much better, XP is almost the same and Mages there are very rare.  &lt;I&gt;	-- prok 2/19/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I dont know what everyone is smoking but I am lvl 38 mage and with my draining and my lvl 6 buffs, Tuskers are about as hard to kill as an ant. Trust me any mage which casts 6s will kick tusker ass, only problem with BSD is such a slow spawn rate, and it almost forces us to steal kills :( &lt;I&gt; -- Ghandalf 7/25/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>New Dungeon near Ayun B with a portal that can be tied.  Didnt go too far but Lichs and lots of them in the first room &lt;I&gt; -- An Tse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a couple of key chests in here. When you get past the liches, you will find Obs golems and Revs. Nothing but a surface portal at the end. &lt;I&gt;	-- Tayway(TD) 6/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Additionally there are two rooms with quickly respawning granites and irons &lt;I&gt;	-- Timm 6/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The acid pits have 1 illusionary wall in them&lt;br&gt; its the wall facing the hallway as you jump over to get to the Iron Golems.  So if you fall in, you can still make it out alive....once you get past the Revenants or have Item Magic.  Additionally, there are 2 Obsidean Golem rooms...easy to get overwhelemed when being attacked by 5 of those puppies. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khaos 8/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;PLEASE NOTE:  The dungeon and suface portals can no longer be linked nor summoned to. &lt;I&gt;	-- Psy 8/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont know when they changed it but you can now Tie to the entrance portal and summon. &lt;I&gt; -- Fleshreaper 6/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Geez, Turbine make up your mind! I get the message that I cant tie to entrance or surface portals when I try.  I have not tried the one at the bottom though and will do so soon. 7/6/01 &lt;I&gt; -- Hrothgar 7/6/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Couldnt enter, cap is level 5-15, but I am sure it is one of the new dungeons introduced with the june patch.6/6/2000 &lt;I&gt; -- Sis. Immacolata&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many many mosswarts, from creeper to barker/mudlurk.  No shaman.  In many of the winding passages there are tons of traps, mainly acid.  As you are entering the tunnels, the traps will miss you almost every time...  But, if you are running out of the tunnel chased by mosswarts, you will be hit almost every time, so watch out.  A few minor chests, not much else. &lt;I&gt;	-- Fenping-TD 6/7/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Area surrounding portal is clear, but the foyer is a hot zone with six or so mudlurks ready to greet you.  Design is swamp dungeon, including solid cattails that act as barriers to movement and war magic. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was plaing on darktide and jumped in here to escape from some PKs who were camping the sho roadside portal exit.BAD IDEA!!dont come in here unless you can solo AT LEAST FOUR mosswarts who will come at you FROM ALL SIDES. &lt;I&gt;	-- death to you ha 3/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>New dungeon discovered in the recent prop on 6/6/00, what ancient horrors await us in this new dungeon? PROBABLY OLTHOI! Level 30+ &lt;I&gt; -- Embryodead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont bother going here i alrady killed all the olthoi. DEAD &lt;I&gt;	-- Dagger McGee 9/24/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon is not there at the mentioned coordinates.  No sign of it.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Brindle  10/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is most definitely there. &lt;I&gt;	-- Adric the Red 2/4/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you cannot find this dungeon via AC Explorer DO NOT goto 55.3S 43.45E.  OHN is not there, you will need to go to 55.8 *NORTH* 43.5E to find it.  Its not very far from the Bandit Castle OHN.  &lt;I&gt;	-- prok 2/23/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It appears that AC Explorer is not properly updating dungeon info when theres a coordinate conflict such as this.  I doubt this post will be of any help to AC-E users are they will never see it unless they come to this site.  &lt;I&gt;	-- prok 2/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Moved in the Treaties of Stone event (July 14, 2004), to 88.6S, 25.9W from 49.0S, 66.4W   Tieable, Summonable, Exit to surface just inside.  This is now where you upgrade the Blue Singularity weapons to Purple (Martinate Holding for changing Purple to Green ).  Be careful in this dungeon, If you die with your Blue weapon, you will lose it.  At that point you must wait a week to begin again.  You need lockpick to get to the bottom, there is a 40 resistance locked door near the top.  The top of the dungeon has altered drudges and as you continue down you meet Virindi Observers, Executors  and Terberous Hollow Minions in good quantity.  You can lure many of the Hollows into a pit near the bottom of a large room and snipe them from above. At the very bottom there is a room filled with blue crystals, a few SIK chests and a blue Virindi NPC (Virindi Castaway, level 11) that asks you to hand him a Singularity weapon for an upgrade. &lt;I&gt;-- Buttros -- Brassyl  -- Virindi Inquisitor of TD -- Seeker -- Lila_MT &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Level 30 and above.  So I could not enter it. &lt;I&gt; -- Pounce, HG&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, first floor full of workers, about 15 second respawn time, go one ramp down and full of soldiers, same respawn time, very narrow hallways, if someone is being attacked and runs, those who wait to late will die.  They will be trapped within this mess.  Farther down you come to a room which everyone calls the ""flood room"".  Not sure how many have been here.  Narrow hallway going into this room, soldiers swarm in.  I did not have time to approximate the number of soldiers here because there was just to many to count.  I would say at least 50 hit this room at once if not more. 3-6 uber chests found so far.  Unless you like vitae, I wouldn't go to far down. &lt;I&gt;	-- Eichschet 6/8/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spawn time is now more like 2-4 minutes.  It isn't bad if you are alone in there, but with 5 or more people running around, it is a mad rush to try to get some bugs to yourself. &lt;I&gt;	-- T-Bird (HG) 9/1/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you're coming up from Zaikhal, make SURE to come at this dungeon from the east. It's in an impassable box canyon from the west. I hate mountains. Stupid, stupid, stupid design. Wasted 45 minutes running around trying to get down, so at least you get to save time if you go. &lt;I&gt;	-- Arisana 11/25/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The surface to this dungeon is very quiet, great place to buff and also has a nice view of the landscape.  At the bottom of the dungeon usually has a surface portal, but not this one.  No the Zak OHN has a portal at the bottom that takes you to the Bandit Castle OHN (surface of course).  This is great for when Zak OHN becomes too camped, but then again so is Bandit OHN. There are 2 Uberchests in the dungeon, I would fully ignore the 2nd chest on the 3rd floor (in the flood room where about 20-30 Olthoi Soldiers spawn in a large room with a narrow entrance hallway).  Ive gotten nothing but crap (Gems!? Stam elixors!? im insulted!!). Note: Olthoi Soldiers become alot easier to deal with when using Level V protects.  Acid and Piercing IVs just dont cut the mustard.  &lt;I&gt;	-- prok 2/12/2001 &lt;/I&gt; Has been moved to 40.4N, 34.5E from 48.9N, 12.9W.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;I&gt;-- Armin 12/12/2004&lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Millions of Drudge Raveners, Stalkers and Lurkers and some Virindi Servants, really fast spawn. At least 2 uber chests. &lt;I&gt; -- Snake&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Less ravs, more stalkers and lurkers. Virindi are servants, not too many. 2 uber chests in the same room. another chest that I check repeatedly but never got anything. &lt;I&gt;	-- Theneler (TD) 6/9/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warning to people without item magic, it is possible to get trapped in this dungeon, without a way out. There is a lot of jumping from this to that in this dungeon, and there is one spot near the end that you cant get out of without recall or summon. I counted at least 4 chests when I was there.  &lt;I&gt;	-- IpNomad (LC) 7/23/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lots of Stalkers and Lurkers.  Only a few Raveners.  No Altered Drudges.  There's about 3 Virindi Servant spawns in there.  Be careful now that the virindi cast bludgeon vuln, the drudges can hurt while they're kicking...  The above poster was correct, there is one room that has no way out unless you can recall.  2 uber chests, 2 chests I didn't check, and 1 chest-not-so-uber. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield Bond 8/5/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a great place for lifemages 25+, tons of stalkers and such to drain, and once there all dead (nearly an endless supply of them) you can jump down, and collect your uber loot. Really nice. ;) &lt;I&gt;	-- Tiabin 9/21/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Dunno about collecting ""uber loot"". I usually jump down and collect a fish or two, a gem or two, and a heavy virtually worthless shield or two. Stalkers here seem to drop even worse loot than outdoor Stalkers and I've never found a Rav gut here (although it seems Turbine has lowered the gut drop rate considerably everywhere). Fun place to meet some wall-huggin life mages and perched archers, though ;) &lt;I&gt;	-- Janx Spirit 10/18/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The above post about not being able to exit the last room is incorrect.  The room in question is the one with the 2 uber chests and the virindi in the middle.  If you take the tunnel opposite the stairs and go left, at the end you will come upon a set of iron bars.  Those bars can be opened.  Jumping down puts you near the main entrance.  Makes a great escape route in case you get ovrewhelmed. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kisama Ryoken 11/21/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your incorrect about the non-drop of Rav Guts..I have gotten 6 guts there....but it took me from level 25-30 to get them... &lt;I&gt;	-- Rykar Stonestel 1/19/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;guts, keys and Xp best place i have every been too. It is a power lvl Powerhouse when it's not camped. Lots of fun stuff out side when it is camped &lt;I&gt;	-- the dead 1/23/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you're a mage with melee defense you can buff with 6's and jump down into the ""pit."" You will get many more kills using war spells than the life mages will camping on the ledge....but it does take some big balls to pull it off against 7 or 8 stalkers! &lt;I&gt; -- Happy Spellmore 6/16/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How times have changed... now a lonely place. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/4/2003 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>North of Zaikhal. No entry restrictions. Full range of basic Mosswarts in early stages and most of the Banderling race in the later stages. Spawn is very rapid and large groups are encountered. Always some more rushing to help the current bunch youre fighting. Didnt find much beyond the locked doors except a surface portal leading to the entry point. Theer were parts of the dungeon we may have missed through our exploration and constant battling. Found by Agamemnon. Fought through by Katsumii, Agamem, Chibi and God. &lt;I&gt; -- Katsumii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is Full of Mossworts, mudlarks barker, shamans at least as far a I got, which Wasnt far.  The respawn is fast and I only got a little way in by myself before I was ankle deep in mossie corpses.. It is rather large and you should definately take a group just to keep up with the respawn.  Or take lots of stamina potions.. &lt;I&gt; -- Stranyr alQroni&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Futher Down you get knee deep in Banderlings, Breeders, Captains, Ravers, Guards, Raiders .....made it to the end and thats about it &lt;I&gt;	-- The Vampire 6/24/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great place for levels 15 and up for experience. Re-spawn rate is incredible. Above notes correct, bring stamina potions with you...preferable in bucket loads. &lt;I&gt;	-- Leifson 6/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the ULTIMATE place for a mid sized lvl 15-25 group to lvl. You want a challenge, you wanna see some of the coolest battles in all of dereth? Youve come to the right place. Murk Warrens has only 2 BREEDS of monsters. Mosswarts (Feeders-Cheifs) in the first half, and Banderlings (Scouts-Ravers) in the second half. In 1st area if the dungeon, the monsters only rush in at the front (about 5-15 at a time). As you progress in the dungeon, they come in about 20 at a time, in front, and 10 rush in from the back. Oh, and remember that the respawn time is 2 mins, so alot of times, as you kill 1 wave, another wave will spawn behind you. I didnt know my way around too well, because it is dark, and so is my monitor (it REALLY REALLY sucks), but when you get to a locked door in the mosswart area, DO NOT GO IN FOR GODS SAKE. There are about 10 moss cheifs and 50+ other mosswarts that will rush out as you open it. Besides that, when you are fighting that group, youll get side rushed by a group down another hallway. There is also a room in the banderling area with the same situation, but diffrent look. Just look for the locked doors. This place IS NOT reccomended for mages =P. I know because I am one (lvl 22 all schools mage), and I went with a group of Melee fighters. If your a mage, stay in back and cast de-buffs on the stronger guys and heal, &amp; infuse stamina on your allys. If you waste mana using war spells, your done for because theyll start to rush YOU. If your in a group, make sure all the melee fighters are lvl 20-35. Mages can be any level (we had lvl 11, 17, 21, 24, and 32 melee fighers, and me, as a lvl 15 mage). &lt;I&gt;	-- Al-Tuvah 8/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dungeon is new school with heroic physical dimensions and spawn rate.  A nice place for mixed levels to work on leveling.  Entrance and foyer are both safe. Running in from Zaikhal (south) is safer than running in from the north. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 10/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont even bother coming here unless you have a small army of low level people with nothing better to do than kill mosswarts.too many for anyone to kill them all alone.Nobody is ever here!why did turbine even make this place? &lt;I&gt;	-- Sega Slayer 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>i just saw a lvl 60 banderling berserker in here. i engaged it with my sword from behind a gate and to my shock and surprise, the dang thing opened the gate and hit me down to 4 hp. at lvl 10 with sword 144 i had no chance. next time ill not try hitting him thats for sure. the rest seems accurate enough. &lt;I&gt; -- Tattoo 1/23/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The above changes in the dungeon are because it is now part of the Elysas Favor quest. I will put the details under the Fort Witshire entry since that is the last dungeon you need to go through to complete the quest.  &lt;I&gt; -- Krell (LC) 1/23/2002 &lt;/i&gt; Mid level Banderlings and Hollow Minions inhabit this dungeon.  Toward the end is a large room full of Hollow Minions. This room has a Storage Chest containing a Glass Spherule.  Find the key on a hollow, then return the Spherule to Sir Rylanan  &lt;I&gt; -- Taarna Blood SC 10/11/2004 &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The notes below are out of date and for historical reference only.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Really nice banderling temple NW of Holtburg. Cotains Young Banderlings and Scouts at the top and Banderling Guards and Raiders further in. Found 2 chests with gems and 1 level 2 magic ring. Nice design and graphics. I assume this is a new one since I havent seen it posted anywhere else. &lt;I&gt; -- Pyreal Hawk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 5+ restriction &lt;I&gt; 6/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not the greatest loot, but it does provide some excellent sniping spots for archers and mages, but nothing completely safe.  Fun dungeon with nice mists. &lt;I&gt;	-- Yoshi Suji 9/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Yup, went there today with level 10 archer and two mages. We had a blast fighting our way down to the bottom and up again. There are two paths to take. Lots of narrow tunnels and few open places means its possible to have a meat shield protect the flimsy mages. One of Dereths better low level dungeons. &lt;I&gt;  -- Immacolata 5/12/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Seems to be similar to the one at 56.6S, 86W.  3-4 Tusker Slaves at entrance, lots more deeper in.  Managed to get my first +20% vitae at this place but the xp is incredible!!!  Not sure if theres another level (I didnt find one) but didnt go all the way through. &lt;I&gt; -- Steve Al-Thos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 20+ &lt;I&gt;	-- Steve Al-Thos 6/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon really sux. &lt;I&gt;	-- BaelZevuv 6/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sucks? Its awesome. I can earn a million xp in maybe 4 hours max. its awesome. &lt;I&gt;	-- Theneler ( TD ) 6/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Its pretty easy to die in here if youre not careful, but its a great place to get XP.  There are no safe rooms here.  The front room occasionally has tuskers in it because someone brought them up there.  This is a great place for a small group of mages to lvl up!  The surface portal cannot be tied to, only the entrance portal.  Just be sure to bring all your bludgeoning protects. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield Bond 8/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;this place is easy if you are buffed with pros and banes &lt;I&gt;	-- Gordan 8/19/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I dont have anything against mages, just mages who insist on casting on the tusker im fighting when there are 10 tuskers on me. Get your own tuster buddy :)&lt;I&gt;	-- Fullcrum 11/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good tying point for Obs Plains hunting. Steel chests nearby. &lt;I&gt; -- Khazeh al-Qunat 7/13/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 20 restriction, but in reality, no 20th lv player will survive in there without serious help. Robe mages beware: if youre not casting at least 5s in item and life you will not survive (and I mean at least!) Great xps if you can get into a fellowship. An OG/BM combo works great in here. &lt;I&gt; -- Tuspec of MT 12/30/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon is amazing, after the monster rebalancing, these tuskers are worth about 20,000 XP per kill. This BSD inparticular is really never camped, because not alot of travelers know about it, and therefor you can make mad levels in no time at all. &lt;I&gt; -- Rush of WE 4/13/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Nice dungeon, good place for a party of chars L5-8 or so.  Tons of Drudges (Prowlers, Slinker, Sneakers) on a pretty quick respawn.  Found two chests, one locked, the other with typical low-level loot.  Just be careful as the Prowlers are pretty smart about finding a path to you -- its easy to get swarmed if youre alone. &lt;I&gt;-- Ibn Schachabo 2/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This holds the key needed to enter Swamp Temple.  Key is lying on the ground at the back of the bunker.  It's a Mosswart ambush point, when battle starts a dozen will show up inside and a couple dozen will close from outside.  Grab and run works... if you don't get stuck in the crush. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stock AL 50 Chain Hauberk and Stock Tachi also spawn in here.

    <description>This is a lugian house-style dungeon: no portal but three levels deep in the wilderness world. There are about 20 swamp rats and a granite golem greeting you outside. Swamp Rats are lightning breathing brothers of Mountain Rats -- just as ornery, but only half the level. Inside are at least 2 shadows, another granite golem, and 3 liches. Approach from the life stone and arch mage hut just to the north.  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place has MANY hidden passages and rooms and makes excellent use of optic tricks to hide them. Search Carefully! &lt;I&gt;	-- Senshin -MT 9/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3 liches?  Try like 10.  A lich lord, 2 shadows, 4 shadow children... this place is really good if you can survive it -- I was able to solo it at level 24.  Bring your healing kits and stamina potions, as the liches drain through walls and you WILL need to heal.  Oh, and theyre not just optic tricks -- some of the walls are fake and hiding more liches, shadows, and treasure chests. I made 75k XP in about 20 minutes here, which was quite nice for my level. &lt;I&gt; -- Daija of HG 11/26/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

If you give them a skull from the High Advocate, you will receive the gold key which lets you in, a special 1-use key that opens the door at the bottom of the Mines (to the home of the vortex that powers the Focusing Stone) as well as 12000xp.

    <description>Bring here an insignia from a Tumorok and shell tell you how to save her sister.  She says she rewards well. &lt;I&gt;	-- Soo Many Voices 10/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;     The woman is Yu Vuo-ki Gold.  After you give her the tumerok insignia, she tells you that her sister is on the edge of Dryreach and you have 30 minutes to find her.  Go to the house at 9.0S 73.7E, and she is locked in the cellar.  Her sister, Dansha-Ki, will tell you that she needs her spell components to escape.  Tumeroks took her belongings north, just moments ago.  After you talk to her, a tumerok guard will spawn.  Kill it and it drops bone key, which you must have.  Her belongings are in the Tumerok Tower at 6.3S 73.6E.  Use the bone key to get in and her pack is at the top.  Take her pack to the Tumerok House and give it to her.  She will give you a Gem of Portal Recall and Dansha-Kis Ring, which is Magic Resis III &amp; Lightning Resis III (diff: 110).  You can only perform this quest once in a set time frame. Not sure how long. Not sure why youd wanna do it more than never.  Lots of Tumerok Warriors, Fighters, and Scouts. &lt;I&gt;	-- Harkoth  11/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Dryreach or Portal Gem Quest is broken.  I gave Yo Vuo-Ki (2) Tumerok Medialion and she does nothing.  Found further information that Turbine has permanently discontinued this quest because of the portal gem. --Keltor Trynos 05/22/01 &lt;I&gt; -- Keltor Trynos 5/22/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not true, I handed Yo Vou-Ki a tumerok insignia, and she started off the quest. I didnt get to finish it though, due to a disconnect. But I assume since she starts you off when you hand over the insignia it isnt broken! &lt;I&gt; -- Fistandantillus 7/14/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, I spent 2 days looking for her and she was nowhere to be seen. We killed every Tumerok for miles (inc. Officers) and there were no Insignias dropped. We also could find the Bone Engraved Key. I tend to agree with the theory that Turbine have retired this quest... &lt;I&gt; -- Jaz 9/20/2001 9/19/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I just completed the quest fir the portal gem and Dansha-Kis Ring.  I found the gold insignia on a Tumerok officer up the hill from the East Direlands Swamp portal (8.1S, 74.4E). &lt;I&gt; 3/16/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Level 15 and up. Probably a copy of the dungeon by Ayan Baqur. &lt;I&gt; -- Niethra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Liches, Iron Golems, pits of acid (have to jump) &lt;I&gt;	-- Krylos (TD) 6/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pass liches and jump to acid pit. you will find a secret passage there. there are a lot of revenant here. they cast lvVI spells... &lt;I&gt;	-- Elder Merlin 7/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have been here several times in the last month and have yet to see anyone else here, probably due to the LS being a long run away. &lt;I&gt;	-- Renroc 11/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The portal here is tieable, the entrance is clear, as is the foyer.  Fast gen Lichs and a Lich Lord just beyond the foyer, golems and other monsters beyond that. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 11/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I spent most of my time hunting here, but got sick of it.  Too many level 15 archers camping the Iron room. When a level 15 archer can take on 7 Irons at once, and survive, you know theres something wrong. Anyways, rant aside, I dont know how it is now.  If its like the above comment, Im going to grab my tie back there again.  But I highly doubt it, since this one is the easiest of the three to get to. &lt;I&gt;	-- Duress 11/26/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;LOTs of revenants (8 in the first part and another 8 passed the Obsidian golems). Heavily camped, but good XP, lots of SIKs, and peas &lt;I&gt; -- Neoson 7/30/2001 &lt;/i&gt;Iron Golems, Liches, Great Revenants, Granite Golems, Obsidian Golems, This is a great place to pick up motes and hearts &lt;I&gt;-- Druxus (MT &amp; FF) 6/13/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This dungeon is the one with Liches, Revenants, and assorted golems.  Very cool architecture. &lt;I&gt;	-- Aphex - HG 6/17/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is clear, restriced to 15+, foyer is clear.  But beyond the foyer the gen rate is spectacularly high. Liches and Lich Lords on what seems a one minute gen cycle. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 6/19/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh thats complete garbage. YOu try to jump across, a simple procedure, yet, hit your head and fall into a pointless acid pit.  Remove this CRAP TURBINE Increase the ceiling size or put a portal there. Its nonsense to lose things because of such a stupid stupid feature. &lt;I&gt;	-- Goldhart 7/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a wall you can run through at bottom of acid pit. You stand in the middle, jump, then run like heck through the wall to get to other part of dungeon.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Ceasar Camerion 7/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the very beginning, there are, as stated, liches and a lich lord on short respawn. After you run through a little complex full of undead, you can choose between left or right. If you choose left, you have two options. The straight ahead one takes you to a room with granite golems, but the right one leads over an acid pit (jump 130+) and after that a corridor which winds down to a room full of irons on a short respawn. This is a great place for melees of level 25 and up, who can handle the multiple spells. Room also holds a sturdy chest. If you pick right in the corridor you can jump over another acid pit and get to another iron room. In this room there is another corridor leading to multiple Revenants. &lt;I&gt;	-- Mr Briefcase 8/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They call it Paradise for Archers, get some acid arrows and lvl really fast (5000 xp for every iron) &lt;I&gt; -- Neoson 7/30/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Many Scouts, Fighters and Warrios in both, the one to the east seems to be a barracks of some kind and is more crowded.  The whole area is full of Tumeroks and they seem to rise up out of the ground.  Warriors throw lvl II and sometimes lvl III bolts.  Cant give better description as I was almost killed marking the coords.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Eastern house has a cellar, the stairxase is near the northern door.  Both houses have two chests upstairs, no loot.  There is also what I will call the Tumerok Picnic Area west of the western house, at 9.0S, 72.9E, where a warrior, two scouts and a fighter are having kunch around a small table.  Anything you attack in this area will cause reinforcements to come running, but they dont seem very interested in fighting. &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 10/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Entry is courtesy of   -- &lt;I&gt;Polecat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5 or 6 Tumerok warriors, an officer, and 1 or 2 grunts occupy a one-sided defensive barricade.  Most are on the ground behind the wall, a couple are on the ramparts.  This is a dangerous spot to attack alone as the Tumeroks will not allow you to tease them into single combat, and the firepower coming out of this position, especially the back side, can have a mid level warrior running for cover.  Level III magic bolts, and arrows fired by level 20 Tumerok Warriors.  The loot is heavy, mostly magic weapons and armor, but Dryreach is visible from the wall.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;WOAH!  Did I forget to mention that the Officer throws level V bolts??  One shot took almost 100 points off.  Also, if you kill a Tunerok within range the others seem to get a fix on you and you will suffer a rain of arrows and magic bolts.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Entry is courtesy of   -- &lt;I&gt;Polecat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A little military style combat.  Dryreach is under siege, and the Tumeroks have set up this roadblock to restrict travel into the city.  You cant really see the house from the road.  You will know you are getting close when you see the tower off to the left.  If you are travelling on the road you will not see the sentrys until you are caught in a crossfire of quarrels fired from behind the protection of roadside bushes.  Best to start from the outside and work your way in.  About 4 fighters and 5 scouts guard the road, and sometimes the back side of the house.  2 Warriors are either in or near the house, and they will occasionally fire level III bolts at you.  But this is a defensive position, and the Tumeroks fight like humans.  They wont chase you far.  You have to go in and get them.  They like to stand behind cover, bushes, trees, rocks, so archers make sure you have a clear shot.  A mid level warrior can handle the grunts pretty easily, but watch the warriors and bring your magic resist or your heal kits, because those bolts sting.  When you attack the house itself you may trigger a massive spawn of reinforcements, but they dont seem to want to cross the road, and I have never been able to engage them in battle.  Where do they go?? The loot is heavy, and mostly magic.  But take it.  You will rake up in town, as the prices are quite high.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are actually two spawning points here, one directly in front of the house and the other is a little ways north.  Depending on how long it has been since someone came through and cleaned it out there could be as many as 20 Tumeroks between the two spawns, 4 or 5 of them being warriors.  The warriors WILL chase you, especially if they have you injured.   &lt;I&gt;	-- StoneCold 9/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Nothing that a level 3 could not handle easy. Only thing about this place I liked was the design, very nice dungeon layout, maze like almost, creepy sometimes...wasted on the mobs currently there. A lot more dangerous outside, almost got swarmed by 3 Mites. &lt;I&gt; -- CD - DT  2/19/2002 &lt;/i&gt; No restriction now. Otherwise doesnt seem changed at all.

    <description>Entry is courtesy of   -- &lt;I&gt;Polecat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a low level dungeon with restrictions on higher level characters &lt;I&gt;	-- Saphyre Blue 7/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually there is no level restriction on this entrance.  This portal takes you to the top of the dungeon listed as Zoobool Tower (21.7N, 19.4E - which you must have just come through, as its the only way to get to this mountain top), just above the dungeons exit portal.  There is no exit portal at the bottom of this dungeon, so the only reason to use this upper entrance is to enter, blast the lvl 20 lich, exit back here to the mountain top to heal/recover, and go back in again to blast the lich some more.  Not fair for the poor lich!  &lt;I&gt;	-- Larce Mantoll 10/3/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Entry is courtesy of   -- &lt;I&gt;Polecat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This a a stone which you can jump on and if you stand in the right place you can kill the 5 Olthoi Workers that spawn like clockwork.  If you stand in the wrong place you will get killed.  This stone is very heavily camped, in fact, some people have moved mules onto the rock and never leave.  If you fo during the heavy times you will probably have to share space with 2 or 3 other people.  If you are not a high level archer you will get next to nothing out of it.   &lt;I&gt;	-- Jann 9/29/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As of June 01 patch, there are still olthoi workers spawning. Is camped pretty good too by archers. Watch out for a group of Drudge Lurkers, Stalkers and the new Dark Claws that spawn nearby. If you get there attention they will cast level 3 and 4 wars/debuffs on you. &lt;I&gt; -- Jake the Dog 6/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Murk Warrens: NorthEast of Baishi. No entry restrictions. Full range of Mosswarts and very very rapid spawns. Good for lvl 15+. Didnt get far into dungeon since i was alone.&lt;I&gt; -- kang Wong-Li&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lots of Shamans.  Further on you run into Banderlings, then more Mosswarts inlcuding a Chief.  We were running low on supplies, so we fought our way back to the exit and left.  Still lots to explore... &lt;I&gt;	-- Siergen 7/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you are 25th or below, this is an excellent place for sellable loot.  You can kill/re-kill the first two spawns (regens every minute or so) with little danger and (by being selective) easily make 30k a trip.  Portal or LS recall is recommended as this dungeon is quite far from town. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sooyoonow 2/10/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>West of Stonehold.  Probably a copy to the other two Murk Warrens found to date.  The top level is full of mudlurk and barker mosswarts, spawning very quickly.  Did not go any further.  Many banderlings, tuskers, and wood golems around the entrance - not a safe place to rest from the dungeon.  Exit portal near the entrance point. &lt;I&gt; -- GladiusHawkwood&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>South High Mountains, Near Baishi And Qalabar.  Dungeon added During Julys Patch, Contains Ore at the end of the dungeon &lt;I&gt; -- RaidenTheVampir&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rather sparsly populated with Laigus and Amploth lugians embueded with the charming ability to ignore any and all magic, include banes, vulns, war spells, and protects.  Magic users: You have been warned &lt;I&gt;	-- JA 7/11/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The above poster was right. If your a mage you NEED to whip out your atlan, and got get some armor and shield. You can buff you weapon, and stats, however watch out for the dispel magic traps. Mages in robes&lt;br&gt; be ready to be 1 or 2 hit. Imagine yourself running in there naked. . because you are. &lt;I&gt;	-- Theneler 7/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Get your low quality ore here, makes a hollow weapon same damage as superior atlan but useful for pk as it cant be buffed and ignores armor/imperil/impen/banes &lt;I&gt;	-- mengar 7/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think its medium quality ore.  And yes, mages are screwed here.  I got killed in one hit by an obeloth (oops).  Mages can avoid the mana drains by running alongside the walls while going through here though.  If youre a mage going through here, bring warrior friends to kill for you. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield Bond 9/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Poster above is incorrect, it is low-quality ore that you can mine here.  Again, mages should just keep the hell out of here.  Melees in the high teens to low 20s can make it as long as there are two or more of you.  You only need one ore deposit as they are No Drop and useless except to make the Hollow weapon of your choice &lt;I&gt;	-- Syndi 9/19/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This mine is also a decent place to level if youre a melee. Groups of 3 amploth and laigus up top are no problem, the toughest part will be once you get down to the mining floor/caves about 8 can come at you from both sides if youre not careful. Oh, and if youre looking for the ore, go straight ahead (going around the rings as neccesary) until you get down to the bottom floor. Then go right, and youll find a portal to the surface and the ore. When in doubt, go right. As above, not too tough for a melee in the high teens or low twenties. Remember though, your Armor jewelery is pretty much useless. &lt;I&gt;	-- Jadok al-Siran 10/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Skeleton warriors, captains, and lords. This is the resting (not quite actually) place of Mi Krau-Li. &lt;I&gt; -- Xinister&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A note is in the sacrophagous. The Jitte can be found near the Sacrophagous, guarded by a skellie lord. Its not so obvious, I missed it twice. &lt;I&gt;	-- Xinister 7/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Did this quest the first day of the patch, the Jitte is infact lower down the dungeon after the sarcophagous with the note 2 branches lead deeper left and right. Actually they both end up the same way but the Jitte is on the floor in the room farthest to the left guarded by a couple of skele lords and other misc skeles. Be warned the second part of the quest is alot tougher i soloed this place at lvl 34. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sem 8/10/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is Chalcimere Fortress -- an oasis in a drear direlands plain.   The Gates to this castle are guarded well, the Door has a lockpick resistance of 242.  There are reasonably easy jump-up points on the north wall. The fortress is inhabited with Revenant, Mu-Myiah, Obsidian and Diamond Golem, and its a good Diamond Golem hunting area. Spawn rate is slow.   Falahda The Emissery opens a portal to Aerlinthe for a C note.  &lt;I&gt; -- RaidenTheVampir -- Doc Feelgood -- Silverion DD -- DaOlthoiKiller -- Temunji Sakura -- Taarna Blood SC&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Hill was only approachable from west side.  I assume this is where you take your jitte for new July jitte quest.  Top level is all Skel captains and Lords, lower levels were lords and Skel Bone Knights. Oddly never saw an acid weapon.  Doors are all lever activated off torches. But I wasn't able to get back to any of them with a 269run in time. must take at least 2 people. Bring friends. &lt;I&gt; -- Senshin-MT&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok talked to Makish and the final section is Bone Lords,Bone Knights, and some misc. Skel Lords behind the doors. Switches are aparently a major pain. Be sure to be about 35+ lvl to hit the Bone Lords. &lt;I&gt;	-- Senshin -MT 7/12/2000 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

Layout of the dungeon is medium-size with large rooms.  The main room on the top level is so big that you can get into some interesting in-sight-but-beyond-radar battles.  Contains Burun Ruuk Louts and Fiends near the top, with Seers and Soothsayers at the bottom near the chest room.  Spawn is quite fast.  To open the chest, use Strong Iron Keys from the Small Complex just north of here.  Chest contains a Stone Clasp (bracelet), 10 Renegade Herbal Kits and some lore titled "Correspondence."&lt;I&gt; -- Dotto and Temunji Sakura -- Khaos -- Doc Feelgood -- Taarna Blood SC&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Approximate location of Aerfalle Keep dungeon portal, spawns during the Aerlinthe Isle Quest.  Discovered by One Man Army of FrostFell.  Main Gate is locked and requires lockpick skill.  Known to be the home of the powerful undead, Lady Aerfalle.  When killed she drops a key to the chest upstairs in her room and a note regarding the shadow wars.  &lt;I&gt; -- The Spectre   8/24/2000  &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No Recall, No Tie Portal.  Beware the Level 7 Dispell Trap between the first two doors.  Full of Relic Bones, Diamond Golems, Umbris Shadows, Firestorms, Cursed Wisps and Rats.  With the quest update during From the Darkness Born  this dungeon now has 2 level breaks.  In order to get the Recall Scroll, you MUST give the Sacrifical Dagger from Aerlinthe Reservor to The Ghost of Galaeral who is inside this dungeon.  He is located near the start on the right side near the exit portal and is behind a lever door.  The Dagger weakens Lady Aerfalle and activates the 45+ quest.  If you do not hand in the dagger, Lady Aerfalle will be the 80+ version.  In the high level version she is very dangerous and should not be taken lightly.  She dispells and casts Self protect spells if debuffed.  Lady Aerfalle has around 5000 hp and looks like a living Empyrean woman, a very mean Empyrean woman.  Use rending weapons and War to defeat her.  She will lock onto a single person, debuff them, and then beat them mercilessly.  Bring Healer Hearts, dispell gems, and a well organized group.  She also has some VOD type undead bodyguards.  Regardless, she drops around 9 keys in both 45+ and 80+ versions.  The spawn does not stop and maintains its relatively fast rate.  Run up to the chest room, minding the 2nd Level 7 Dispell Trap at its entry.  Use your key on the appropriate chest.  The 80+ Version does NOT get the recall scroll, however the items are much better than the 45+ version.  The 80+ Ashbane can be given to its old owner for 10 million XP while the 45+ Ashbane gives 500k.   &lt;I&gt; --Taarna Blood SC 10/13/2004 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>For the most part the Mayoi beach is just like every other beach with Azure Gromnies, Blue Phantos Wasps, Water and Mud Golems... until you get to this location.  I have seen a number of mid-level characters hunting the beach only to get to Point Despair and get jumped by Shadows, Shadow Lieutenants, Lithos, Gigas and Amploth Lugians, Great and Snowy Mattekars or Ash Gromnies.  The spawn is different on a daily basis.  The best suggestion, check out that low, dark shape as it approaches you... what you think is an Azure Gromnie will more than likely be an Ash or two, or three... Also, there always seems to be a Bandie or two in the mix just to stir things up. &lt;I&gt; -- Ool&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even saw a Diamond Golem here.  A group of us just stood there trying to decide whether we should attack it or not... decided not was the best answer.  160th level was the read on it. &lt;I&gt;	-- Ool 9/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is the camp mentioned in the parchment Banderling Camp Directions and is located inside one of the smaller creater bowls.  A small number of banders spawn in this camp including a Banderling Bandit who will spawn at random a Fire Spear, quarter staff of fire, or fire arrows or sometimes nothing.  On occasion he will also drop two of these items.  The camp respawn rate is 15 minutes.  The other banders include youngs, scouts and one captain.  A nearby chest usually spawns food. &lt;I&gt; -- Cuttler Strngmd&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Just NW of the Shipwreck, this is a pretty simple dungeon.  What makes this stand out was the Sata Sclavus at the bottom guarding a SIK chest. There were about 25 Satas on a 60 second spawn. No match for a lvl 50 swordsman, lvl 53 mage, and archer.  We made short work of them.  Alot of fun for the fact of nothing else to do.  Btw, only about 2k exp per kill. Its not worth the effort for experience. Oh yea...the SIK chest is a low quality one (lvl 4 enchants and spells). &lt;I&gt; -- dcp-cystemzero&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This description is a little dated I think.  Check the description for the other Sclavus Cathedral near WaiJhou for a more detailed description.  The larger Sclavus drops a hide occasionally that can be made into a snake skin coat - Armor Level 130 with decent protections.  The coat is like a breastplate with sleeves so it can be worn with Shreth pants or Amuli.  In 1/2 hour I got 3 hides near the bottom. &lt;I&gt;	-- Blau (MT) 4/15/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Location of the Shendolain Soul Crystal in the Obsidian Plains.  Use Shandolian gate key (duh). Dimond Golems, Dark Revs, Skel Bone nasties, etc. &lt;I&gt; -- Brassyl&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Outside area is very ugly at times, and the enterance drop off is good reprieve, however, if you're level 35, not 36, and try to enter the portal for retreat, you will be horribly disappointed... &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield3d 10/8/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Shendolain Gate Key is used here, yet the Shendolain Crystal is not here.  The dungeon isn't really all that hard, but you must have someone camping the switch room for you.  One can get to the switch room by following the Right hand wall from the start. Only hard part of this dungeon is a room with 3 plasmas that jump down onto your party.  They usually jump down one at a time however, for some odd reason. &lt;I&gt;	-- Flamelord of LC 10/14/2000 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>According to ACTips this is the Caulnalain Vestibule Vault for levels 26-35.  Havent been there yet so I have no idea of the monsters.  The key to this vault can be found on shadows. &lt;I&gt; -- Rendar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;100% true - Starts out with 2 not so big jumps, after the 2nd jump there are pairs of shadows, the textures are even worth the visit alone. &lt;I&gt;	-- Richard the B. 9/23/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;woah boy-I did not like this place.It starts out just Shadows then LTs. Oh and then a panumbri. My party of 4(one archer and 3 meleers) killed the panumbri, then further in met another that killed me and another of my comrades, NOT A FUN PLACE!!  &lt;I&gt;	-- Dark Stryder 10/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place has the eeriest feel Ive ever encountered in AC as yet, nothing compares - not Olthoi dungeons, not anything.  Its gruesome and scary and quite wonderful!! :)  The key you need for the gate at the end only drop off Shadow Lieutenants, so if you are in this dungeon the Fenmalain key is useless to you.  I got to the very end with a party of 4 and I only saw 2 Pans the entire time.  We didnt really know the way, but it seemed as the purple portal mist got thicker we were heading in the right direction, and we did indeed find the gate. &lt;I&gt;	-- Silvermoon 10/2/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok, This Place is Sorta Kool, I ran Through it last Night, I tried to solo it but Didnt get too far due to the Magic Happy Shadows, I went with me, and Archer, and a Mage, ended up meeting 5 more at the entrance, and 3 on the way there making the place WAY too easy, Umm, You go through a Buncha Shadows, then a Couple LTs, a Couple Pans, A Couple of shadows that are Labeled Caulnalian Guardians or something, not Sure what they could be, I was able to Hit them Grat with Axe mastry 4 on, But when it dropped I couldnt hit them with my 235 Base, so whatever they would be, You Put yer Key in the Gate and It Gives you a Portol Gem,, I think that you Could LS recall, and Re-Stock or get level 6 buffs from someone or what not Because I think you can Use the Gem that takes you to the Second Part of the Dungion NP, I think the Hardest Part was Jumping into the Pi with a Buncha shadows in it, Just Because most everyone was afraid they would be the only ones to Jump and Would Die, besides me and a COuple others who did Jump, I think that my Party would have Made it but it would have been Hard, If you are Going in a Small Party Be sure to Bring a Mage as a LOT of them could Just as Easily Be Drained, at the end of the Dungion there was the Cauln Crystal which I averaged about 15 - 25 Per Swing on, I usually got like 6 swings whatever that means in a Big Party, there were 2 r 3 other Crystals that Spawned there, Not Sure of the Names but they were also Easy, I would say that the only troubles that I had Was the Caulanian Shadows when my Buffs Dropped, I got the Shield, SL 140, Like 1300 Burden, +10 to Health 15 or 20 to stanima I forget, Invuln 4, Cant be casted on, its Kool Looking but about worthless lol, I ran there from Holtburg, was a Very Short Easy Run, was able to Avoid Mountains until about that last 2 Clicks, Just be Careful in there, A Melle Mage Might have a Chance Soloing the Place, and a Good Melle Would have slim to none, the shadows woud have to keep magic at a Minimum, Kool Scenery, a Fun Place &lt;I&gt;	-- Crystal Knight 11/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New level restrictions:  26-40. &lt;I&gt;	-- Path 12/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Geez! I wish People would take some time when writing their notes. The one above sounds like it was written by someone on drugs. Get it together Knight! &lt;I&gt;	-- Artek 1/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jump thru the portal at full power, when you exit the other side you will land on a ledge, the vault will be right infront of you, may be 1 or 2 shadows near the vault, just grab your key and recall.  Best to run here from crater. &lt;I&gt; -- BuffDaddy -MT 8/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The upper level limit for this quest has been removed. &lt;I&gt; -- Kovich of TD 5/17/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Ladies and Gentlemen, without further ado I present you the savant &lt;I&gt;Tyr on HG&lt;BR&gt; --  Immacolata 7/20/2003 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Yes this is a random dungeon, yes there are allready a billion and one entries for it &lt;i&gt;(edit: no more, cleaned out a kajillion of those, thanks to Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;), yes I am apolagising for entering another one, but I tried several times to add to the Floating City (Primary) thread and managed only to put in one line... so here is what I was trying to say, assuming this adds itself. There is far too much speculation and rumour on this thread, so, since I know virtually everything there is to know about the city, let me set a few things straight. Firstly, portals may now be tied and recalled to, they cant be summoned but if you see one on the landscape, tie to it, and camp it for any friends who may want to tie too (random portals only disapear when the landblock resets, so if your watching the portal it wont go anywhere). Secondly, there is no pattern to the portals appearing, they are RANDOM! Thirdly, multiple portals can spawn on the surface, the city is broken up into 8 different landblocks (7 called The Floating City, and one The Golem Sanctum), and I think all of them can be created as random landscape portals. I think the golem sanctum only spawns in the dires but I cant confirm that). Thus all these reports saying when you enter go this way are useless because it all depends on which part of the city you have entered. Now, when you enter the city, your first step is to do a /loc and work out which landblock your in, then before jumping off anything or going through any portals, check ACMaps.com which has maps of the city (done by yours truely). So far Ive only done 6, Im waiting on the random portals to take me back to the final two landblocks. That raises another point, many of the portals between the different parts of the city are random as well, which is why you should tie to the first one you found, as you may not be able to get back to explore more. Inside the city, all exit portals, and lots of the internal portals (all helpfully called just The Floating City) are random, but unlike random portals on the surface, they are allways in the same place, but every month (on patch day) they change their destination. On the maps I have made all portals are identified as either stable or random, stable portals all have a return portal next to them to facilitate two way travel. Lockpicking is not required, but does make a little more of the city accessible, it is I believe posible to get everywhere by random portals but random portals are of course random. The toughest door is resistance 322, and worth picking if you can because it leads on to a stable portal to another section. There are what apears to be two significant points of interest in the city, one is the golem sanctum, an absolute labyrinth of tightly twisting passages and more junctions than I can count, all filled with Iron golems, and at the end one obsidian with a dispell trap and a chest of crap loot. The other point of interest is something everyone should see at least once in their life, a floating advocate tower in the direlands (3.7S / 69.2W), about as high above the ground as the tou-tou lighthouse is tall, and with a bright pink energy fountain inside it. On top is a random portal to the direlands somewhere. At the begining of the Golem Sanctum is a stable portal back to the city, and a random direlands portal, I have seen these portals go to North Direlands Valley Junction, and my old favorite hunting ground North Direlands Land Bridge. During this months patch I also found a portal whos name and location I didnt write down, but the drop was so hot I died before I materialised. Shortly after that they did a server rollback and the portal changed again. Within the city you will find a number of Strained Books, which cannot be picked up but give you some interesting lore about the place, and some interesting insights into the Empyrians past. In all I would say this whole place is priety much a place only to come if you like exploring and lore, the monsters inside are for the most part, low level undead and a few banderlings, there are 2 virindi servants, and 2 revanants, and thats about it for the high level monsters. However, it does make a wonderful alternative to the Abandoned Mines as a subway, because while the portals change every month, there are a lot of exit portals and they drop you in often rare towns like Kara. A few non town portals spawn, but rarely, and all Ive noticed is Heartland which has to be one of the most common random portals (and the most boring). Anyways, Im begining to ramble on without really saying much, so I will just say that the floating city is a great place to visit, and a nice place to tie to and use as a subway (incidentally the exit portals can be tied to and summoned, so when you find a Kara portal, take a copy of it for your guild, its a nice quiet town that sells level 6 scrolls for those rich enough to afford them). Should anyone be interested in learning more, go take a look at ACMaps.coms maps and post a message on this thread, I look at it occasionally, alternatively if your on harvestgain, just tie to the city and use it to get arround, Im sure well bump into each other there (tho its never happened yet, portals in are VERY rare). &lt;I&gt; -- Tyr on HG  12/3/2002&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This dungeon is located at the bottom of the Uninhabited Area Portal found in the Xarabydun sewers.  It is 1-25 restricted and cannot be Recalled, Tied, or Summoned.  It is also the place where the Crystal Nodules for the Gem of Impulse are.  You can pick up as many Crystal Nodules as you want, but there is a 1 week turn in timer.  They are givable.  There is also a Mid Direlands Portal at the bottom of a 40 damage pit (with Bludge pro 7 and 110 jump)  It is Tieable and Summonable, restricted to 18+.  This exits at 37.1S, 65.9W and is actually the Valley of Death hot drop, which is very hazardous for any lowbie that goes in. -- Taarna Blood SC</description>

    <description>Im not quite sure what is inside this place yet since i haven't found a way in.  Its located up on a mountian near Serac Vault and is surrounded by Lugians.  The lugians near here seem to be new with the october update, at least their names are different.  These lugians are called raiders and I've seen every lugian type except Laigus here, even Extas and Tiatus raiders.  They all seem to be using hollow weapons like the lugians in the ore mines. &lt;I&gt; -- Jandrel&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Couldn't get in either :\ oh well.. easy to find tiatus are sweet. &lt;I&gt;	-- Mengar -LC 10/11/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These Raider-caste Lugians are very mage NON-friendly.  With a 230 skill and rank V's, I couldn't affect the lvl 29 raiders, let alone the 108's and 178's.  They are either EXTREMELY resistant to magic, or completely immune.  Melee-type people have it a bit easier here though, and a mage is still useful in a (sigh) support role.  Extas are 8 k, Tiatus are 15k.  And yes, it's a beautfiul, yet bizarre structure. &lt;I&gt;	-- N'Sciira deGris 10/15/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is a tower i saw that was not on ac explorer and though there was an entrance to but as i could not figure the entrance to this castle out i decided to post it to see if anyone else could find the entrance. there are various luggies on the outskerts with the name of raiders, such as litthos raider, gigas raider, and even taitas raiders. &lt;I&gt; -- Darkmessenger 10/17/2000&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ""raider"" Lugian variants around this Castle are weilding hollow-equivilent weapons.  Mages beware. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kystanto 10/26/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is truly a wonderful sight, but I see no way in. I also saw no high level Luggies in over an hour of hunting there. Where are the Extas and Titas Luggies??? Highest level thing was a Lythos Raider. &lt;I&gt;	-- Shoku Kang  1/3/2001 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Someone mentioned this place will be populated in the feburary patch.  Another comment was made that the size of the fortress is the largest the game engine will allow.  &lt;I&gt;	-- prok 1/10/2001 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Second part in the new October midlevel lost explorer quest.  no level rest.  Mostly mosswarts including many shaman and a chief. 4 chests, 1 locked. The banderling ceremonial mace head is here guarded by 2 Goldenback Tuskers.  Also the second journal of the missing explorer is here. clues point ever on westward.  both head and book are the first east/right passage as you come in. then first right for book, or straight and stay left follow the glow for the head.  Entry room is not safe and the only 2 surface portals exist here. Nice layout, fun traps and maze feel. &lt;I&gt; -- Senshin -MT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually, it is 2 Goldenback Tuskers that guard the mace head at the end.  Also, the exit is not in the entry room, but if you head left and stay left for a ways you get to a surface portal.  There is another surface portal down off a long side passage by the tuskers. &lt;I&gt;	-- J 10/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you are looking for the second part of the ceremonial mace (the haft), its in the Banderling Conquest Dungeon (29S,50.5E) &lt;I&gt;	-- Monkey3 2/4/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, theres a locked chest in here.  When you enter the dungeon, just go straight.  The passage goes into a spiral (right turns), and ends with a locked chest.  I didnt have lockpick, so I have no clue whats in it. &lt;I&gt;	-- Obsidianblade 4/7/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The portal in is tieable, summonable. The exit portal is tieable, not summonable.  Entrance and exit are hot with Obsidian Plains fauna, the foyer is quiet. Its a good portal pop hunting place. The dungeon layout is Lugian citadel-style and has a lot of symmetry. The big corridors and simple layout mean that monsters can come in from miles around, and the fighting tends to be clumpy -- big swarm, then nothing. Spawn rate is modest. Soltiris Hollows are 55th level and drop decent loot. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/2/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Banderling Training Camp - Lots of mosswarts and banderlings, including a banderling captain. The respawn is really quick &lt;I&gt;	-- Lan Mar 11/1/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is one of those monster training camps, as the Banderling Captain drops the note from his General. Population at this one includes up to a dozen Mudlurk Mosswarts, up to a dozen Barker Mosswarts, two Shamans, a Chief, and the Banderling Captain. The spawns for Mudlurks and Barkers is 30 seconds--insanely fast. Spawn time on the others is two minutes. If youre an archer, bring fire arrows and run like hell&lt;br&gt; if youre melee, bring friends and stam potions. Good place for mask heads and brown beans, though. &lt;I&gt;	-- Arisana (SC) 11/4/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This place has also been called the flosting power generator, the entrance to this place can be found int the floating city. As I found the place by accident, and many of the portals in the city move as well as the ones leading to it I can give no accurate directions, other than to say that I passed a portal guarded by several lichs and a revenant to get to the portal leading inside. Ill be giveing pictures taken to my guild on solclaim which can be reached at www.valour.acsage.com And to give credit where it is do I was asked by Epsilon Alpha to list his name here as well since he was with me when we entered. The tower is empty but has some interesting scense inside, worth a visit but not a return. &lt;I&gt; -- Corus Firebrand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tower was not empty when I when there, ...it had a Direlands Desert NE Portal in it with the drop point of 82.1S, 59.0W...which coincidentally also is close to another portal, the South Landbridge Portal (drop: 83.3S, 19.2W) at 81.9S, 59.0W. &lt;I&gt;	-- Sword of Truth 12/11/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I confirm that the entry to the final section of the floating city is a portal in the Revenants bedroom closet.  The Portal in the spire dumped out at Northeast Dires junction when we visited (2.3N, 65.2W). &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 2/2/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Occasionally the odd swamp rat/mudlurk mosswart pops into town, particularly to the mage shop (which is just a bit west from the main town). Most of the dealers will buy at &gt; than the value of items, and the mage sells peas (the tool is 72k there, however).  &lt;I&gt;	-- Ruiner-Eraser 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mage wears a purple faran, different color than the master robes. Also, dont sell anything to the weaponshop, bowyer pays around 50% more. Has an Ivory Crafter/Leather Crafter. &lt;I&gt;	-- mengar 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vanten (Archmage) - Sell:110% Buy:180% Brita (Barkeep) - Sell:100% Buy:150% Kamira (Grocer) - Sell:80% Buy:160% Sharon (Bowyer) - Sell:130% Buy:160% Imad (Jeweller) - Sell:110% Buy:160% Illic (Weaponsmith) - Sell:90% Buy:170% Padira (Armorer) - Sell:100% Buy:160% Sanami (Healer) - Sell:110% Buy:130% Natalie (Scribe) - Sell:100% Buy:150% Sanami the Healer sells potion spell components as well.

After that, if you bear right you get slithis and low level moarsmen&lt;br&gt; if you bear left, you get sulthis and high level moarsmen and a portal which will take you further into the islands. Be careful not to mistake the high level stuff for low level stuff. It is possible to run past the sulthis tentacles easily, but be ready to deal with the putrid moarsmen beyond. &lt;I&gt;-- Red and Gold 11/21/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Fun change from spellcasters but at this time on Leafcull there are 30 people wandering through the dungeon. &lt;I&gt;	-- mengar 11/14/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place has a uber chest in it that spawns weapons, gems, armor, and cloths.  Only race restriction I saw was gharundim.  Uber loot is of medium qualtity. &lt;I&gt;	-- Rendar 11/15/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is clear, foyer is clear.  Top looks like a small ""Q""-shaped place if you miss the corridor heading down.  Lower level is big and meandering.  Fanatics and idolators up top, zealots below. At least one locked door. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 11/19/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Uber-Chest is behind a locked door which you need to pick. It is guarded by a few Zealots and a Soul-Trapper. Made 3 pulls off the chest and all of it was expensive but sellable crap. 4 floors to the entire place, mostly Fanatics and Idolators until you hit the 4th floor. The bottom end is anti-climatic, nothing but a dead-end. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield3d 11/24/2000 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

Even farther in are several more Putrids and Foul Moarsmen.  Bring acid, fire, and lightning protection, and bring a bunch of melee friends and stamina elixirs.  Use of a shield is highly recommended.  A very ambitious dungeon for the level restrict. &lt;I&gt; -- Accident 7/7/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This place resembles a component from the Empyrean Power Plant. I was playing a 17th level mages and I was alone, so I didnt chance it.  &lt;I&gt; -- Sixfingers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Gone down a few levels so far - lots of level 60 sclavi - throwing lvl 5 war spells.  Site is guarded by 2 Cursed Wisps (lvl 89) &lt;I&gt;	-- Quixis Blight 11/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Deeper:  Ulu Sclavus (60), Faisi Sclavus (74), Slithayr Tendrils/Tentacles/Eye Stalks, Liches, Lich Lords.  Didnt find anything of interest beyond that. &lt;I&gt;	-- Kelyn Blackwolf 11/19/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is hot with wisps, foyer is quiet.  You have to jump down and run through a big Ulu Sclavi-infested room to get to nearest exit portal.  Upper levels can be wall worked. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 12/31/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This ruin isnt very small. &lt;I&gt;	-- Keef the Thief 1/8/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes its actually quite small, its not even truly 9 rooms.  Its only 3 floors, and there are less than 50 creatures total, respawns are about 3-4 mins though, so it can seem large. (also note this is a duplicate entry, I entered all this months ago.

    <description>Interesting back-story for this town. (in relation to Kryst, and Bandit Castle...) Quite dangerous, as high level baddies seem to stroll right into town frequently... Side note:Bowyer sells Armor Piercing, Regular, Frog Crotch, and Blunt Arrowheads, as well as bolts and arrow shafts., and Archmage sells Tapers, as well as Gold and Pyreal Scarabs... Majiya Bint Branith, HG &lt;I&gt; -- Majiya bint Bra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Expensive shops and they dont give near what Teth/Ayan Bakur do, some starter towns pay better. &lt;I&gt;	-- mengar 11/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Arrgh, me hearties, a wickeder pirate town is hard to find.  These merchants will skin ye coming and going. But the mage does offer shiney gold and pyreal, and shell service ye with dispell magics should ye have the need. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 11/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This town along with the vesayen isles themselves can now be seen in your user friendly in game map thanks to the new December 2000 patch. &lt;I&gt;	-- Archbow 12/12/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the starting pt for the January Bandit Castle handle quest. Give MacNial a idol gem and he will give u letter to his cousin in bandit caslte. &lt;I&gt;	-- Saint Thomas 1/9/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>I didnt spend much time inside but guess what I found....  Sometimes the name says a lot. &lt;I&gt; -- Shoyu Suru&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This appears to be a dungeon of little point, the end part with 3 putrid moarsmen appears to be it - however this room is very tomb Raider in design, Id like to see where somebody with a high jump skill can get to - there are other monsters in here that cant seem to be got to. Contains 3 lvls or moars - (the easy ones), rank and putrid, plus there are shallows destroyers, jungle wasps, and a water golem (????)! &lt;I&gt;	-- Typhoid V 11/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Tough little dungeon for 3 mid-20s players. On top were Shallows Destroyers, Island Dillos, and a Jungle Phyntos Wasp. We didnt go further, because they were too tough for us. &lt;I&gt; -- Adra Mar Sula&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you say OUCH?  The abover poster is correct on the creatures Id seen so far.  A Destroyer is waiting in first corridor while 2 island dillos and the wasp are in the open room the hall leads to.  Just like the above poster I didnt go any farther, 15 vitae in about 10 min on a lvl 28 life/war/creature/ua changed my mind :P &lt;I&gt;	-- Rendar 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Levels 10-30 only. In my opinion, the level restriction is very low considering whats inside, and considering whats on the island where this dungeon resides. You go from Mosswart Shamans on the island to suddenly being greeted by Island Dillos (lvl 38) Jungle Phyntos wasps (lvl 65) Shallows Destroyers (lvl 37?) and Shallows Devourer (lvl 50-some). I would recommend a group of at least 6 to 8 decked out level 25-30 people to even attempt this dungeon. Be ready for some serious tanking. The dillos and destroyers are immensely painful. I went in here with 3 lvl 26+ Melees and we got wasted hard, I ended up with 15% vitae Personally, I feel this level restrict needs to be fixed. On the other hand, the exit portal is a great place to tie to if you are levels 10-30. its close to the lifestone as well as the new city &lt;I&gt;	-- Jadok al-Siran 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I got a wee bit further in (just past the wasp) and ran smack into a ghost wisp.  barely made it out alive after that with dillos spawning in front of my escape. &lt;I&gt;	-- knockturn 11/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ugh.. Finally got to the end of this surprisingly small cave. After the Wasp, there is 1 island dillo, then 3-4 destroyers going straight followed by a brutal devoueror. TO the right was a wisp, and maybe another dillo. Both paths end a short way from the fork. Big thanks to Shemsu, and Zyrel on Frostfell for helping me finish exploring this place. &lt;I&gt;	-- Adra Mar Sula 1/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Today I soloed the place in 10 minutes as level 29. High melee defense helps a lot in here. Beautiful but disappointingly small. &lt;I&gt;	-- Immacolata 3/22/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Dungeon contained Sclavas and Revnants &lt;I&gt;	-- Fenrus (MT) 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is guarded by Sclavi, including one who blocks the doorway. Exit is hot with same sclavi.  Dungeon is a single room filled with Slavi, undead and a tenticle. Foyer is modestly hot. I found two chests, one was SIK the other was open. Entrance and exit are recallable, but not summonable. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 12/16/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Floating advocate tower (open type of dungeon), lots of dark revs (nothing I conned was lower than lvl 111), probable entrance to this place is at the portal that is by town on big island (portal loc is 83.1S, 93.2E, HEAVY concentration of undead, bring BIG group). &lt;I&gt; -- Kylos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Confirmed the entrance portal is Perimeter Portal. &lt;I&gt;	-- Fenrus 11/15/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just to clarify: the majority of the higher undead are not in the Advocate Tower, but in a nearby castle. Dark Leeches, Dark Magus, False Dark Revs, Revenants, Skeleton Lords, and Scalvi too. &lt;I&gt;	-- Oceanus 11/17/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Perimeter Portal near Santuary has been removed, so there is no longer a way to enter this tower (that I know of).  Also the portal to Chalicmere that was inside seems to have been removed. &lt;I&gt;	-- Firilisun 12/14/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

This is am amazing site to see, the trip is well worth it. Note: there is no LS close to this so be careful! &lt;I&gt; -- Chogall - FF 11/15/2000&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Abondon castle by town on big island (nov Patch), top most floor got a eirie cathedral music with chest off unknow difficulty, basement got a cript, with a altar to turn pk into non-pk.

    <description>A small winding dungeon filled with newer, tougher, religous fantatic mosswarts, 35-45 levels. Entrance is clear, but monsters are nearby, foyer is clear. Tieable, no level restrictions. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place has been in the data base for 24 hours! Please check before you enter your finds. &lt;I&gt;	-- Stop the Spam 11/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Correction: the entrance can be hot. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 11/22/2000 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Right near MacNialls Freehold. Swarming Mosswart Idolators, Zealots, and Soul Trappers, Shadows (small children to Lts), a room with kneeling small chadow children in a circle, and at the bottom a Harrower Greivver, a couple Goldenback Tuskers, drudge raveners, and one Sotiris HollowMinion standing over a large bloodstain with Sir Martines Journal (excellent lore, btw). Creepy dungeon.  &lt;I&gt; -- Kerrara&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The entrance can be hell - you can be gangbanged by 10-15+ mossies here - not too bad if theres no Zealots among them but those guys musthave been going to the same armorer as the bone lords cos those fire swords reaaaaly hurt :). Bring LOTS of stamina potions. &lt;I&gt;	-- Typhoid V 11/16/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is hot, foyer is *very* hot with fast-gen fanatics and idolators.  Zealots get dragged into the foyer by fleeing heros (sorry, fast advancing backwards heros) &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 11/20/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Okay, this is the place for the Virindi Essense, which is a necessary part of the Singularity Weapon Quest.  You need to use a Sturdy Iron Key on the chest in the Sotiris Hollow Minion room.  Take the essence and leave. =)  Nothing else is here unless you WANT to waste your time with some weak shadows. =) &lt;I&gt; -- Gynax 7/5/2001 &lt;/i&gt;The thick spawn of Soultrappers makes this a fine place to hunt for Life Magic Ruined Amulets (for Sunstone Gauntlets).  The other mossies here drop Ruined Amulets for War, Item and Creature, as well. &lt;I&gt;-- Doc Feelgood 1/21/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Is a fallen advocater tower, with 2 island wasps inside, and one outside. You need 225 jump to get inside the tower. Chest found inside, need lockpick skill to open it. Loot regular &lt;I&gt; -- Okupa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The wasps guarding this tower are Jungle Wasps, actually.  The chest inside is no longer locked, but produces low-quality weaponry loot. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 6/29/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

No idea what it means. &lt;I&gt; -- Cyphersnow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; That message still shows up once and in a while. I wonder what it refers to - the Mistress Chest perhaps? Anyway, this place has a sculptured guardian stone looking west, and there are nearby benches one can sit on to enjoy the view over the waterfall and Ithaenc Cathedral. &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata 5/1/2001&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a PK altar down stears. The need to find key message is shown when someone doubble clik the altar - without a key &lt;I&gt; -- Loke 8/27/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;please note that none of the comments about messages and altars has anything to do with this view point.

Zealots are very bad dudes, and if you attack one you will be attacked by all of them.  Along with the mossies there are Jungle Wasps on the hill (if you dislike Gold Wasps you will HATE these), Island Dillos and Shallows Destroyers on the beach (the baddest Dillos Ive seen yet).  There are no structures, there is no place to hide, and if you get injured on the hill the dillos on the beach will make you run for your life.  Of course, first you have to get to the hill.  Did I mention the Island Dillos? &lt;I&gt;	-- Lars Larsson 2/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Coords are a bit off, as there are 2 of these camps within a few meters of eachother. From last months story line.... this is one of the locations where you can find a training camp. In a small ring you will find 3 Drudge Raveners, and up to 5 or 6 Tusker Guards, and a Virindi Master. They are being trained by 3 Tumindeon Hollow Minions. The spawn rate of the monsters is a bit crazy, if you can clear the camp in about 2 minutes you should do fine, goodluck. I havent found out the true meaning of this area, as it seems that the storyline took more of a turn to the PK god. There are not many that know of this location, but dont be surprised if someone is there camping the tuskers.  &lt;I&gt; -- Partycrasher&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>BaelZharon High Level Quest Dungeon, Entry level contains virindi (inluding observer), tuskers, hollow minions.  &lt;I&gt; -- Afreyt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Virindi Masters/Observers, Tusker Slaves/Guards, Hollow Minions. Level restriction 36+. Bring 2 large groups. Halfway through the dungeon splits into 2 sections with a 36-45 restricted portal and another for 41+. Both groups must work together as there are a series of buttons/levers that will open doors for the other group. At the end of the high level area spawns the Singularity Fragment which when combined with the Heart of Shadows and the Skull opens a portal to BaelZharons lair. It spawns on the floor between 2 large crystals. The spawn time is around 5 minutes. Be prepared for Bludgeon Vuln 6 from the observers combined with hollow bludgeon damage from the minions. There are some hot spots. The floor at the bottom of a ramp in front of a lever door will do damage and a couple of the large crystals will drain mana. The 36-45 group is rewarded with the Virindi Amulet. Item Mastery 6, Mana Conversion Mastery 6, Exhaustion 5. An easy approach is from Black Dominion or the Obsidian Rim portal exit. Run up the back side of the hill to get to the dungeon. There is an exit at the entrance as well as in the final room. &lt;I&gt;	-- Krell (LC) 12/27/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Virindi Servants Amuljet was upgraded in Aug 2003 patch to Moderate Item Magic, Minor ManaC, Item Magic VI and ManaC VI.

    <description>New lowest level quest dungeon(s) for December 00 update.  One portal levels 15-30 enters a place that then has 2 portal levels 15-25 and 15-30? inside.  results are the Skull of Palacost, a new Obsidian Dagger (4-8?) and the Barbed fletching tool? Was unable to enter myself, just sat and buffed my vassals and others. undead, liches,etc inside. &lt;I&gt; -- Senshin -MT&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Portals are *not* tieable here -- closest tieable are in the Yaraq area.  Foyer is clear, top is clear... barely, mid-level desert monsters are easily brought to top area by heros running in.  Top exit portal is guarded by a lich.  Dungeon is large, winding, and populated with lich and higher level undead (Risen Soldiers and Risen Knights).  The quests are designed to be attempted by large (8-16), well organized parties (know your route, know your levers, plan your body recovery).  &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 12/25/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All liches, lich lords, and Risen soldiers(26)and knights. risen do not cast but have excellent melee. bring your ~190+ jump and as much run as you can.  There are acid pits here I have yet to see a mage cross ;(   &lt;I&gt;	-- senshin 12/27/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inner portals are: lower (15-25) and upper (21-30). Upper side acid pit can be jumped with 148 jump/150 run (a mage doing it ;-&gt;). For a quick jump check, see if you can jump on top of the tall rock at the entrance. If you can, you can probably jump the acid pit.  Upper and lower parties must coordinate their lever pulling to get through.  Lower group gets the dagger and archery tool, upper group gets the skull.  There are surface portals at the jump down point and just beyond the party split point. &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 12/28/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;update: there are *three* acid pits to jump, the second requires 199 jump, third is easy.  Upper level guardian is Mausoleum Director (55th).  Whatever size group you think you need, double it. &lt;grin&gt; (20 would be comfortable). &lt;I&gt;	-- Doc Feelgood 12/31/2000 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, as for the acid pits on the high side which is lvls 21-30, i cleared all 3; the first 2 with a jump of 200, and the last with 220. (this was a standing jump mind you). Also you can do this quest with only 8 people, we had 4 for the high side and 4 for the low. wasn't too bad, just watch for the respawn at the end, if you're not ready for war magic, you're dead. &lt;I&gt; -- Elhanan Jabar 1/5/2002 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Located on top of the Cathedral. The key to the Mistress Chest is located here on a Putrid Moarsman on the bottom. The chest is also located on top of the Cathedral and contains the Healers Heart (Heal Other VI, Healing Mastery VI. Life skill required: 245, Diff: 105). Inside is high level Sclavus, Cursed/Affliction Wisps, Foul/Putrid Moarsman. Not sure if it can be done solo do to the levers. From the entrance, take the ramps to the bottom and pull the lever. In the lever room the Putrid Moarsman with the key is on the other side of a fence. You can kill him but unless your lucky you wont be able to loot it through the fence. This lever will open the south door on the 2nd level. Go through the south door and down one level and you will find a room with 2 levers. Watch the dispel trap on the ramp down and the mana blight and stamina blight floor traps in the doorways to the dual lever room. These 2 levers will open both the North and South doors on the 2nd level. Run up and through the North door on the 2nd level then work your way down. At one point youll need to jump off a ledge with affliction and cursed wisps waiting at the bottom. Work your way down to a room with plants and a cage overhead. The Putrid Moarsman with the key will run in to meet you there once your in range from the original lever room nearby. The easiest way to the dungeon is with the Recall the Sanctuary spell (Copper Scarab, Brown Taper, Comfrey, Personal Taper, Orange Taper, Cobalt, Personal Taper, Rowan Talisman) or take the Vesayen Isles portal south of Bandit Castle at 61.7N, 48.6E and run the length of the island chain. &lt;I&gt; -- Krell (LC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You need lock picks to open the door, at the buttom lever room &lt;I&gt;	-- Qq 1/19/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good strategy to make it through is to throw melees in the front, and have archers / mages behind them firing away and healing.  Form a wall with the melees so everyone gets the benefit of the shield. &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance and exit are quiet. Foyer is hot with Chomu and Ulu Sclavi. Spawn rate is modest. Entrance and exit portals are not recallable or summonable. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/20/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>A little group of creatures, looking kind of like a camp because of the number of creatures, and the rate of spawn. A Bander Captain, Mosswart Chief, 2 Mosswart Shamens, and more than a dozen lower level Mosswarts in the imediate area. Super quick spawn. I was lvl 28, and I had fun keeping up with it. Nothing else of interest, but didn't stay to look around. &lt;I&gt; -- Adra Mar Sula&lt;/I&gt;Updated to Obsidian and Oak Golems, with Ferocious, Cruel and Brutish Monouga nearby &lt;I&gt;-- Chupon 8/19/2004&lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>A new dungeon for Januarys patch. Tumeroks are outside guarding the place with Drudges, Virindi, and a pair of Hollow Minions deeper in. Has many portals to obscure places, including several deep in the dires and the Obsidian Plains. &lt;I&gt; -- Optim Shi &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The portals at the bottom are in the three wings off of the room with the minions.  North Wing -- Bandit Castle (65.0N, 49.3E), Surface (6.4N, 3.9W), Obsidean Rim (48.0S, 65.0W / lvl 35).  West Wing -- South Mt. Esper (56.8N, 12.9E / lvl 12), South Dires (84.2S, 34.4W / lvl 12).  East Wing -- Black Hill (62.4S, 52.3W), North Dires (24.4N, 53.8W / lvl 12). &lt;I&gt;	-- Mariko-san 1/15/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The 3 wings are long hallways from the center room which contains the 2 minions and a Virindi Master on a fast (About 2 minute) spawn. No way to run by without taking some hollow hits.  &lt;I&gt;	-- Krell (LC) 1/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Upper levels of the dungeon are all turmock warriors and priests. Going lower you will meet high priests and officers then finally gladiators. Watch out after the gladiators. There is a mass group of high drudges. Swarming can become pretty bad. The Master is guarded by high drudges and hollow minons. I couldnt solo the group of drudges at level 41 before the ones behind me respawned. Bring a group if your after masks. &lt;I&gt;	-- Dragonbait org 2/2/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In ACexplorer, the exits of this portal are wrongly displayed.

You will need a group to go into the lower Shade stronghold to move levers while you move levers in the Upper dungeon for the lower dungeon.  With a large enough goup in the lower dungeon you will be fine in the upper...the captain is like lvl126 i think but he wasnt a problem if there is enough of you...and he drops the heume...theres a timer as well but unknown length. &lt;I&gt;	-- Roland Chase-HG 1/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

You newbies better be a wee bit careful in here, or you will be swarmed and killed, unless you manage to outrun the foes. For your first time in here, take a friend. &lt;I&gt;	-- Bro.

    <description>Found that at this exact location you can expect spawns of high level critters on a regular basis.  On occasion Ive witnessed Linvak Ursuins, Limestones, multiple Vorous... usually during the day to boot!  The best part about this is that its 25 seconds from the south Heb lifestone.  I camped this location for many a day so it should be pretty stable.  &lt;I&gt; -- Zenaku (WE)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Tuskers, Hollows, Virindi and aparently alot of Kool d00d who have been hoarding these spots to the exclusion of others. Most on a 2-4 min spawn cycle (Kool d00ds included). Usually divided into four seperate camps so this is an approximate position, circle round about .5 to 1 click and you should find all four parts. A lot of people use these places to level newbies or to powerlevel. They also contain the chests which contain the spell scrolls need to learn the Level 7 spells for the Jan patch. P.S. Thanks to Sorren on TD for the coords. -- Phoenix Wolfsun Oh and thanks to Senshin of MT for pointing out its a POI not a dungeon. Anyway the information is back in as a POI so that it shows up on everybodies database.

    <description>&lt;BR&gt;There is also a door above the crystal.  You cans see it visually, but you can ID it.  You can also double click on the crystal, but nothing happens.  I also tried a Fenmalain key on it - it let me use it, but then said you cannot use this key here.  So me thinks SOME kind of key may do something??? &lt;I&gt;	-- Ho Mang 2/17/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok want some help..heh...get your old dagger (bludge dagger) combine with Harrower acid and u get a key...use key in this place... &lt;I&gt;	-- The dead 2/19/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, combine the Organic Acid from a Harrower Grievver with the Peculiar Old Dagger. This will result in a key that can be turned in to the giant crystal for a Lyceum Recall Gem. This will take you to the Lyceum where your War magic skills will be tested against Nephol Golems for the chance to obtain the Thaumaturgic Plate armor. The Lyceum is also where you turn in the Blue Orb to the trainer to receive the Globe of Auberean. The peculiar old dagger is found on a random merchant in the south dires. I found him not far from the south land bridge portal exit at 82.1s 35.7w. &lt;I&gt;	-- Krell (LC) 2/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is the Ishilai Lyceum spoken of in the lore book On the Proper Use and Care of Thaumaturgic Plate.  The Lyceum as it is commonly called, was founded by Exarch Hieromancer Sephrena Mirenndae, who later became Priestess of the Adjanite Sisterhood of Ithaenc.  This will be your destination if you are on the Mage Armor quest.  I would suggest Level 60+ for this place.&lt;br&gt;The Lyceum is on the top of a sheer cliff and can only be reached by using a Lyceum Recall Gem (which you must construct).  It is no recall, so dont die. One of the gem components is on a week long timer.  After you construct and use a Lyceum Recall Gem, you will be transported to a safe area within the Lyceum.  The friendly NPC golem Eaushi the Trainer is there to greet you.  Do as he asks and you will receive crystals.  Give them to him for the uncharged mage armor.  You can also give him a Blue Orb from the Heiromancer Halls and you will be rewarded with the Globe of Aubrean orb.  Or you can give him a Sunstone Geode, a very rare random drop on the Nephol Golems within the Lyceum, for a Heiromancer orb.&lt;br&gt;The entire complex is very interesting and worthy of a look.  There is a cooking dress in one of the locked chests in a building.  The guard golems hold a key to this.  There is also a Lightweight Tome hidden in the library at the mountain peak.  Although this tome is suprisingly heavy, it can be written in.  You can get outside by using a lever or jumping over the wall.  If you have a low jump you may need a friend to stay at the lever in order for you to get back in.  If not, you may be able to jump from the hillside and clear the wall.  Whatever you do, dont fall off.  You may lose your corpse forever. &lt;I&gt; -- Taarna Blood SC &lt;/i&gt;

    <type>Dungeon</type>

    <description>This is a great mid-level quest. The tower to the West is tower 1, the southern one is tower 3, and the one kind of in the middle (and highest one) is the 2nd. Kill the lich in the first, run up inside the thing and hit the lever. Then run inside the second and kill the undead (run inside to get them to spawn) it will open 3rd tower door. Run inside there and kill the undead that spawn outside. Kill the lesser LAST or the quest may break (and youll PISS OFF alot of people). If you learn the spawn points you can jump over the traps and not fight monsters, but other than the liches I found the place easy. On the high acolyte Ive never had a problem and Im lvl 33. You can leave your guy in that last chamber where he spawns and come back every 5 hours if you want to get a bunch of Yucky Keys (4 pulls per key). I recommend doing the chests when theres a few people around, 1 is uber weapons/armor/jewelry/clothes/wands/gems/etc., one is uber weapons/armor and the other is crap. Usually if you go there at hours when a decent amount of people inside there will be a few to tell you which chests are which. All in all its a pretty easy quest if you know what your doing, but if you run ahead and start hitting traps and spawn too many critters (especially in the last section) youll get yourself and others killed. @tell me if you need help.  &lt;I&gt; -- Ken the Feeble&lt;/i&gt; Either play the tower lever-pull game, or more simply, wait for the Lesser Acolyte to spawn (every 15 min.)in front of the towers, and kill him for a portal to appear for access to the dungeon. Dungeon is split into three sections, first section is Zombies, second is Skeleton Captains and the last by Liches. Creatures appear on spawn traps. You trigger the trap, and the creature spawns. Most traps are in the corners of rooms and hallways, but not always. At the end of each section is a Lesser Acolyte that you must kill to make a portal appear to access the next section. Lesser Acolytes improve in level the further you go, until the last one which is level 48. Sadly, I did not loot each acolyte as I went, apparently they have the keys for the 4 chests in the room that have lockpick resistance of 9999. SIKs do not work on said chests. There is also a lousy chest on the west wall that gives crud. Great looking dungeon, lots of neat light effects! Entered by Grundas the Dark &lt;I&gt; 8/8/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An arrangement of 3 towers, each with buttons and/or levers on the inside. The button/lever in one tower opens the door to another tower. Ooodles of little trigger steps&lt;br&gt; entire dungeon quest would be fun for a few mid-levellers, alas, the run to get to this spot is not mid-level at all. &lt;I&gt; -- Garfield3d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;VERRY important note, when nabbing the 4-use yucky key from te high acolyte at the end and hoping the portal to the chest room, you be be MUCH hapier if do NOT use the key on the 2 chests that are on the same wall together. Those 2 chests have TERRIBLE loot compared to the other two, which par with Uber Chests. Be sure to juts wait out the 15 minute spawn on the chest on the bench and the one to its left, youll thank me later! &lt;I&gt;	-- Sargonas 8/13/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;THE safest way to get there : go to Qalabar, take the road that goes south, follow it till it ends, then stay on the serpentine forested hill, it goes to the bottom in a gentle slope. Once there, just follow the valley to the Towers. Youll find some Tumeroks, Mattekars and low level Drudges and Skeletons. Its a little longer, but that way its a mid-level quest. I made the trip with my 10th level mage, without any problems &lt;br&gt;-) &lt;I&gt;	-- Jestra of MT 8/18/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The chests are on a 5 minute spawn, not 15.  Also, to confirm the 2 chests on the East wall have really bad loot.. they DO.  The North chest is mainly wands/gems/clothing, while the West chest is mainly armor/weapons.  The North chest HAS given some GREAT helms though.  All in all a great quest.  Fun for 1st timers too, who have no idea whats going on. :) &lt;I&gt;	-- Dorn Axehaft MT 9/5/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok heres the real correct info on acolyte towers....first of all I need to say its a 7 minute spawn on chests as well as high acolyte.This quest can be done every 5 hours...when you get to the final room there will 2 pairs of 2 liches that spawn as you head towards acolyte the spawn is activated by floor traps...after the liches do NOT enter room solo...unless you can handle it!You can sucessfully stand at the very end of the hallway with out triggering acolyte or liches and buff up for the battle but watch your back people coming behind you will with any regards to you trigger the spawn(I speak from experience here)There are also individuals who will attempt to kill you at this spot(at least on hg)The west chest spawns armor and weapons of various qualities from UBER to UBER CRAP!The north spawns jewelry wands gems and the occasional armor weapons spawns here are usually AWESOME and in my opinion worth the wasted pulls to get that one good one...The best way to get here to my knowledge is to head west from Qalabar then follow beach (northern edge)when you get to the equitarial axis stop and put lightning protects on if you got them~hehe and run like the wind!There is a LS here and i recommend using it!One other important note:There are some people who enjoy disabling the dungeon and then stay in the area...in order to reset(fix) the acolytes spawn to enter the area must be cleared for 15 minutes for the land block to reset...That mean totally cleared the best way to accomplish this is just to log off for 15 minutes...1st and 2nd lvls are cake 3rd gets tough but if you can handle 2-3 liches at a time solo I recommend coming here best chests in the game... &lt;I&gt;	-- Krack of HG 9/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Definitely follow the coast. I went through one of the valleys headed west and saw shadow lieutenants, berserker and striker banderlings and a few other high level baddies. &lt;I&gt;	-- Mothgog  9/30/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The south coast route has spawn points which can produce Bone Knights and Bone Lords&lt;br&gt; Ive heard the north coast route is better.	 &lt;I&gt;	-- Red and Gold 10/6/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just follow any coast! =) Spawns are random and you could see Armoredillos to Shadows to Bone Lords. Even by taking the North shore, you have to cross back South through dangerous land since the towers lie in close proximity to the Southern shore. Run fast, keep your mini-map open... &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield3d 10/9/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Acolyte towers are actually due south of 87.6S 10.6W. All three towers are visible from these coordinates. &lt;I&gt;	-- Slyzzr 11/25/2000 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most of the previous posts are crap...  The real scoop is that the end of this simple quest are chests that are lootable 4 times with the yucky(lucky) key.  For an added bonus you also get a skull worth 12,000 exp to an ivory crafter(great to save these for quick vitae burners).  The problem is choosing the right chests at the end to open.  The chest positions in the room change constantly(previous posts telling what ones are good are worthless posts).  Out of the 4 chests 2 are uber loot.  1 contains primarily weapons/armor and the other contains magic items like wands and jewelry.  The best approach to finding the right chests is to either save your keys until you show up in the chest room with someone that has already located the uber chests or go with another adventurer so at most you both only waste one try with your key.  Note: Unless you are lvl 40+ or you have a nice size party I would suggest staying just outside high acolyte room and draw him out with ranged attacks or spells(evil presence is the killer in the room not the acolyte).  My technique is to cast imperil 4 on the high acolyte to where I can 1 time him with ease when he charges me and leaves his room.  The ONLY drawback to this quest is that you can only do it every 5 hrs.  Another note...  The spawn rate for the high acolyte is only around 4-5 minutes.  BTW another nice technique to conque&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This northern part of the third Vesayen Island has several groups of mosswarts that always respawn. Each group has at least one Soul Trapper that debuffs you at large with various vulns, weakness etc., and the rest is either the fire loving Zealots or the not-so dangerous Idolators. One group in the center sometimes worships a Dread Idol. &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata&lt;/i&gt;</description>

I knew them well... First, the cows were nerfed to sixth level, then the Training Dungeons were enhanced so you came out fifth level, and finally Olthoi Arcade was opened so you could get to 20th level in two hours.  But in their day... they were a prime gathering place for newbies, leeches and wannabe patrons. &lt;I&gt;-- Doc Feelgood 1/14/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>New for the 03/2001 they changed the spawns south-west of GW all the way to Zaikhal, this particular area is very interesting however, because up until this patch a very limited number of Fire Auroch BULLs existed in game at all.  Now anyone seeking to make a White xbow, or bow has more locations to fight the Fire Bulls and get their horns.  Note: for all those who have told you otherwise, horns on your comp affect only 1 thing.. + to defense on your comp bow/xbow.. NOTHING else.. if they tell you otherwise, theyre ignorant ^_~ &lt;I&gt; -- Shal of MT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The aurochs are here, along with some dolls and mannequins plus a mu-miyah or two in the more desert-like areas around the plains.  Interesting place to hunt.  Note that if youre loking for fire auroch horns, kill all the fire aurochs you can find -- I got one horn off of a Cow and another off of a Yearling. &lt;I&gt;	-- Pandarus 4/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still a fair ammount of Fire Auroch bulls. Lots of Broken Fragments as well. Fire Yearlings and cows drop horns, but are not useable for the ivory colored Composite. The guy who carves the horns will take them and not return. They need to be specifically Fire Bull horns. Drop rate is similiar to Great Mattekars. I spent a couple of hours out there, got both my horns, well worth the effort. Gives you only 2% on defence mod, but looks dayam cool. &lt;I&gt; -- Neo Taciasun HG 6/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>New dungeon activated April 1st, Residents include a full range of Virindi, Hollow minions, Tuskers and Drudge Raveners. At the end all of the normal Ayan Baqur NPCs stand, some say some interesting things. Surface portals up the ramps from the NPCs. I didnt check past the surface portals so there may be more. &lt;I&gt; -- Zenogias of MT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hmmm, for April Fools Day the Virindi take over a town? &lt;I&gt;	-- -giggles 4/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lots of Tumideon Hollow Minions, one SIK chest, and the townsfolk of Ayan Baqur. Bring stout for Ulgrim. &lt;I&gt;	-- Khazeh al-Qunat 4/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Surface portals can be tied to.  Welcome to Ayan Baqur everyone. &lt;I&gt;	-- Virginia Plain 4/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Panopticon Dungeon is outside of Ayan Baqur. The Entrance portal is not tyable and is level restricted to 32+ BUT a surface portal inside is tyable which makes AB no longer a non gatable town... Inside you will find Drudges, Tuskers, Virindis, Hollow Minions... and most of all you will find all the former NPCs from Ayan Baqur in one room. &lt;I&gt;	-- Zeeb 4/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SiK seems to smuck. The now-former townsfolk of Ayan Baqur are reduced to wailing now, cant buy or sell. &lt;I&gt;	-- Garfield3d 4/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;59.1s 84.6w nope no dungeon at those cords must be wrong.... &lt;I&gt;	-- Byren 4/4/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Correct location is 59.1S 84.0W &lt;I&gt;	-- Zopem 4/5/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The entrance and exit are covered by local Dires fauna, the foyer is quiet.  The hallways are large, and the layout of the first part is simple.  The first part is a good place for ravener and virindi puppet hunting.  The back is a complex of corridors that circle back on a main hall.  The back is where you will find the Hollow Minions, higher virindi, and their tusker pets. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 8/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Come and watch Dereths economy fall apart before your eyes! &lt;I&gt; -- Sixfingers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yeah thats right, finally the people who cant camp the Frag dungeons (Fenmalain, Caulnalain, and Nexus), or dont have the time to spend hunting the beach countless hours for a set of armor that is mediocre at best, can come and trade their pyreals in for shardage. The current average on shards is about 350k. That sounds about what they were going for. Now you can get them from NPCs. Can we say Lootomatic shards? I however think it will revitalie the economy by making pyreals worth trading for.

    <description>This is the place to get the Sceptre of the Mind. This place is a crater of sorts which has Gigas and Extas lugians up on the rim, and towards the bottom is a spawn of 2 Dread Mattekars. They have about a 5 minute cycle. In the spot they spawn is where the Lugian Commander and Lieutenant spawn, and the Lt. drops the Sceptre of the Mind. On the rim and in the crater are about 4 spawns of Dire Mattekars as well. None of the lugians use hollow weapons.

    <description>Portal cant be tied to or recalled to.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This is the long awaited dungeon leading to  Linvak Tukal (the Lugian Fortress).  It is full of Lugians and Raiders.  There is an exit portal just inside, and at the end is the portal to the fortress proper.  The fortress is full of many beautiful sights to see, and shops, too. Dont forget to pet Balor when you get there... &lt;I&gt; -- Thel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Portal cant be tied to. -- &lt;I&gt;Immacolata 4/19/2001&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The portal cannot be recalled to either.  The portal to the Linvak Tukal City, inside, is also not-tieable and non-recallable. There are regular lugians and the new raiders who carry hollow weapons. &lt;I&gt; -- Sri 4/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is a lot bigger than the citadels and darker too.  Its hard to see where youre going and easy to get lost from the entrance portal.  I would suggest going in with a group as I went in solo very deep in and ran into a spawn of Extas, hard for me to take on more than 2. &lt;I&gt; -- Darcsun 4/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;Lugies have been upgraded slightly.  Starts out with Gotrock Gigas and Gotrock Montok and goes up from there.  The portal is now recallable/tieable/summonable.
&lt;br&gt;Entrance is usually surrounded by Raiders throwing hollow boulders, but the Foyer is quiet as long as no one has dragged the nearby Montok spawn to the Exit Portal. &lt;I&gt;-- Shemp 6/8/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>No longer protected by Kifandals powerful magic, the Lugian Fortress is now finally open to the public.  Enter via a portal at 76.6S, 28.0E, and brave the Lugians and Raiders inside. (note that the raiders have hollow weapons, which cut through creature enhancements to armour).  At the end of the dungeon, there is a portal that will take you to the inside of the fortress.  Overseen by Lord Kresovus and his faithful companion Balor, it is complete with shops, towers, and lots of lore!  A beauty indeed, there are many sights, including some paintings, and nicely sculpted architecture.  There are also some hidden areas and tunnels to explore, one of which leads to what may be the highest point in all of Dereth.  There are quest completion points here as well.  The exit back out is one of two ways: you can jump off, or take the exit portal at 77.4S, 28.0E, which takes you just north of the dungeon entrance. &lt;I&gt; -- Thel of SC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Coords a bit off, besides, its the finest place I ever saw in Dereth, but notch down those graphics details settings or see your game slow to a crawl.

    <description>Located in the mountains northeast of Qalabar.  Drudge and Doll family &lt;I&gt; -- Cuttler Strngmd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon part of the April patch. Its where you get the 2 new Life Spells and 1 War spell. You can enter the dungeon safely with no fear of being ripped upon entering. To get the new spells, there are 3 Named Virindi to kill and loot the scrolls. Head North gets the health scroll, Head west gets the Mana Scroll and to the East gets the war scroll. Very easy to do for level 55 Mage, only druges dolls and virindi. If you jump off the platform and head south there are Tusker guards and Hallow Mindors, ..nasty to a mage, I didnt get to explore much of the south passage but did come across a Virindi that Dropped a Virindi Shard, ...maybe someone can work out what its for. Once you have the scrolls take them to the guy standing out the front of Zaikhals Scribe shop.  &lt;I&gt; -- -= Aratar =-  4/19/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Shard the virindi envoy drops is an event lore scroll. Take to same guy that translates the new spells for a translated text of the shard. &lt;I&gt; -- AllyMcAlchemist 4/23/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Envoys shard can be translated in Zaikhal. Apparently the Virindi are in league with the lugian rebels and are to embark on the destruction of Linvak Tukal in return for supplies of chorozite. Theres nothing else down the South Passage and to reach the Envoy keep to the left wall. :)- Bloodastral and Draxus de Fallon &lt;I&gt; -- Bloodastral 4/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This Virindi laboratory contains the secrets of Aerbax and his apprentices.

He dropped the Orb of Clarity which is a 7-page event lore item. The Orb only dropped when we first killed him..killed him twice more and it didnt drop.. &lt;I&gt; -- AllyMcAlchemist 4/26/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Be prepared to face as many as 7 or 8 dolls as soon as you enter.  The portal out is close (behind you when you enter) but dont enter casually. &lt;I&gt; -- Szu, Solclaim 5/2/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: This dungeon can take several hours to complete if you plan on clearing the whole place thoroughly.  Your best and easiest path is simply to buff yourself up with all sorts of magic protects and run all the way through to the end and fight the Appretice. It is important to note, however, that halfway through this dungeon is another portal that leads to the interior of this dungeon.  Also, rather than plowing straight ahead in the first section, you will want to take a left once you enter the first big room.  Otherwise you will be walking in a loop.  (I wont mention that it took my patron and I 7 hours to get to the end of this dungeon.  LOL.  That was a lot of loops!  =p Bewaret he Apprentice!  Our first try we got him down to critical and he pulled some magic thing that wiped us both out.  The next person who went through must have found at least 8 mage robes so, lol.  We were too tired to keep going and called it a night. Running through only takes about 5 min.  (duh!) Remember Virindi have high immunity to cold and electrical attacks but are average against the rest.  There are also dolls here.  These are mainly Pristine and Innocents.  Manequins and Dark Manequins make up the rest.  These pretty much are the same as the Virindi as far as immunity.  Although Fire seems effective on the manequins.  ----Svetlana the Homeless &lt;I&gt; 7/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance and exit are quiet.  The foyer is hot with a half dozen or so Pristine and Innocent Dolls. The layout is large, but simple in shape.  Following right hand rule took us to the mid-point portal in about 15 minutes.  Be prepared for gangs of half dozen or so dolls and marionettes.  The second half has more Dark Marionettes. No level restictions, and the portals are tieable and summonable. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 2/26/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Great sell rates on almost everything, but hard to get to (no portals here?) and no lifestone nearby. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 5/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you plan on following the inner sea, toward the Dires, counter-clockwise, looking for Dires-type critters, the first spawn point is located at 13.6N, 46.4W. Along the way you will encounter a few Shadow and Broken Fragment spawns, but the bulk of your encounters will be Water Golems, Blue Wasps, etc. &lt;I&gt; -- Lila (MT) 5/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a portal from Zakhail Located at 16.7N 1.6W  They seem to buy everything except Gems. Nice Fort-like place. &lt;I&gt; -- Catdancer (HG) 5/22/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This place is surrounded by Tumerok Overlords and Commanders. They are of the Grommnie faction so beware. I am not joking when I say they are everywhere around here and in groups of three and four. The lifestone nearby the fort was camped when our party was here with at least 6 Overlords and 2 Commanders. Not a pretty site at all. Scary. &lt;I&gt; -- Wildstar 9/3/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Update to this location. The following are at this tower: Banderling Ravers, Banderling Breeders, Banderling Captain, and a Tumerok Warrior. All are lvl 12 monsters except for the warrior who is lvl 20. Nobody camping the area anymore. Also respawn rate was pretty fast while I was there. be prepared to run since they like to mob you. good for experience if you are at least equal or lower then monster levels. Ravers have a tendency to try and cast spells on you. In my case they never landed. Surrounding area has low to mid level monsters. &lt;I&gt; -- Alcuk Flet-cha &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Nothing to get excited about. About the only real use for this place is a good way to get to OP, and for 40th lvl + char ther e is alot of Masters you can kill pretty easy to get masks. &lt;I&gt; -- Dark Man - Sol 6/23/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dont think you need to do anything to make it appear I use it as a starting point now for OP hunting and it is always there. &lt;I&gt; -- Shaddai 7/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>both entrance and exit portals can be tied to. open entrance with surface portal. has drudge ravners and lower virindi in it. very easy dungeon. at the end is the directors majordomo. and he tells you, Another flesh petitioner! The director is very busy, altered one. are you not aware of all of the additional work he has to do since our experiment in the human desert town went awry? He then tells you, If you do not have one of the Quiddity orbs as your token to enter, i must insist that you turn around and join your squealing fellows. I heard that this is a two part quest and the other dungeon is restricted to lvls 23-35 but I dont know where this other dungeon is. entered by At Patrick Drake &lt;I&gt; -- of sloclaim&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The 20-35 level dungeon is summoned whenever you kill a Black Claw Raider (around the southern and northern mountains.) In those dungeons is how you acquire the Quiddity Orb. As for this dungeon, the place also has Stalkers as well, but at least no Tuskers. &lt;I&gt; -- Garfield3d 6/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon is way easy, Im level 45 UA, and it was a walk in the park.  Hardest point was 4 ravs and a virindi puppet.  The dungeon is very large, which makes me wonder why they didnt add a ton more drudges.  All in all, with size and the spawn, the dungeon seems empty. &lt;I&gt; -- Githzerai 6/17/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Around this area (June 01 patch) you will find the North Blackclaw Leader (a ravener-class drudge)hanging out with a bunch of ravener cronies. Kill him and he will open a portal to the North Quiddity Dungeon. The portal is not summonable or tieable. The foyer is safe. The dungeon is filled with pure drudge -- from lurkers to raveners. Its a fine drudge XP source. But sadly, its new school design so there are few wall working opportunities. The BDT (Big Dungeon Treasure) is a Northern Quiddity Fragment, carried by the same Blackclaw Leader you dispatched to get in. Spawn on the leader is fast (about 4 min).  Theres a one hour quest timer on picking up the fragment. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dungeon is fast spawn. Expect Lurkers at the beginning, more Stalkers as you get to the middle, more Raveners at the end. The above report is inaccurate in two minor respects: youre looking for the Northern Black Claw Raider to get the entrance portal, and he can be found with Lurkers and Stalkers, not Raveners. You will want to kill the Northern Black Claw Leader for the Northern Quiddity Fragment at the end, though. Also, note that the level restrictions are 20-35. I havent located the exit portal -- theres not one right next to the end of the dungeon, but when I do Ill post coords. Oh, and this dungeon is not a duplicate of the Southern Quiddity dungeon. &lt;I&gt; -- Constantine 7/8/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The exit portal at the entrance pops you out to 61.9S, 77.5E. Theres also an exit portal at the end, way past the Leader -- 12.6S, 47.5E. &lt;I&gt; -- Constantine 7/9/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Latest development changed timer for pickup (not spawn) of the shard to one week... No More Camping :) &lt;I&gt; -- Bocephvs 7/12/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A Northern Blackclaw Raider found as far west as 73.4N, 15W. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 8/21/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In November patch Blackclaw Raider was spotted just south of Bandit Castle (66N,50E) &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/25/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>New dungeon with the July 2001 patch. Explore with at least 10+ level 60 or higher. &lt;I&gt; -- Homer the Wise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are augmented drudges on the first level, then the new *painful* hollow minions and new tuskers. You need like 380+ meele to even think about hitting the them, and it is very hard to evade them as well even with very high meele defence. If anyone knows anything else about this dungeon please add it on. &lt;I&gt; -- Homer the Wise 7/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Exit portals at the top are Obsidian Rim portals. &lt;I&gt; -- Constantine 7/12/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A decent pair of lvl 60+ melees should be able to solo this place. At the bottom there are four different ways to go, all lead to a Guardian of Singularity with different monsters in his room. Whoever gets the kill on him is flagged to go to the new Singularity Caul island (a portal to it is up the ramp N from entrance dropoff) - 5 or 8 minute respawn. Tusker Guards/Virindi Masters to start with, a little more inside and its new hollow minions and Rampager Tuskers. Further in youll find Augmented Drudges and Virindi Observers (fire vuln VI and both cast bolt VIs) Jumping in the pit to the South is a shortcut and a way to avoid most tuskers and hollows, bring lightning protection if youre planning to jump as you may get hit by 3+ Lightning Streak VI traps &lt;I&gt; -- Merubin (LC) 7/15/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;a new sickle is found there, its good &lt;I&gt; -- bob 7/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>July, 2001.  Found by Magi on MT.  The dungeon is full of dolls of all types.  In order to enter it you must have already killed a rift and gotten a message to the effect of the power of the rift enterd you  Hopefully something in this patch will trigger somethign besides dolls in here. &lt;I&gt; -- Feral&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Warden Dirrich is now spawning at the very bottom of this dungeon.  He drops Shackles of Obedience&lt;br&gt; be warned that these are no-drop and  no-give. Even to NPCs. Dont pick em up unless you want to keep them for a long long time. &lt;I&gt; -- Constantine 7/17/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It should be noted, to enter the portal you have to continually attack spawning dolls and rifts till you receive a message that you have been changed, then you may enter. The entrance area is safe. All you need to do is head down the hallways either running past the pairs of beaten and battered dolls or killing them. You will also meet the occasional narrow rift. You will come to a large area that you must jump over - be warned if you do not make the jump you drop into a caged area from which there is no way out except to recall. Continue down after the jump till you finally reach the caged area where the virindi that has the quest item spawns outside of the cage. The dungeon is more for a mid level player as I soloed this easily at lvl45. Loot is fair to poor. Dungeon atmosphere is pretty nice with the hot red colors -- Jox the Burley 7/18/2001 &lt;I&gt; -- Jox the Burley 7/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>New Quest Dungeon, tie-able. Beginning is filled with low level tumeroks. Middle portion contains drudge lurkers and stalkers. At the end are the simulacra, who look just like humans. The Northern Infiltrator Leader drops the Shield of the Simulacra (Impen IV, Strength IV, Coord IV, Diff 35, Melee 180+) &lt;I&gt; -- Suriel, MT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is September 01 patch. Entrance is sometimes hot, foyer is quiet. Dungeon is small and the layout of medium complexity. Interior is decorated in an intense red with an eery sort of twisted pattern.  Fun to see. The similacria come in Crafty (15th), Sneaky (33rd), and the Northern Infiltrator Leader (70th).  The Leader is *very* tough to hit.  But, if you group assault him for long enough, he will run out of stamina and succumb to normal attacking.   &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 9/17/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you went through the Southern Keep before coming here, be advised that the Northern Leader is much harder to hit! Soloing this one is impossible - a party of three or four, including a mage and archer, is recommended to minimize your chances of dying. &lt;I&gt; -- Wylfghar 12/28/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is the other new dungeon in the September patch. Head South if you get lost. Tumeroks in the beginning, Stalkers and Lurkers in the middle, and Simulacra at the end. The Southern Infiltrator leader is a Gharu woman who debuffs with level 6 life spells (bludgeon vuln 6) and uses war 6 spells too. She drops the Helm of the Simulacra (Impen IV, Invuln IV, Impreg IV, diff 35, melee 180+). Thanks to Leaver, Kieintie, and Wolf Temptress, who stayed and helped me get mine. &lt;I&gt; -- Suriel, MT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance can be covered by local desert fauna. Foyer is quiet. The dungeon is small and of medium complexity. First part of dungeon is basic brown walls.  Inner part is simulacrium pink. It is essentially one level. The similacriums come in Crafty (15th), Sneaky (33rd) and the South Leader (70th).  The south leader did not seem nearly as tough as North leader, but perhaps both are more vulnerable to archers than meleers. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 9/22/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While this dungeon is significantly easier than its cousin near Zaikhal, dont underestimate it. Soloing is virtually impossible. The spells cast by the helm compliment those by the shield well, making the set the equipment of choice for mid-level melee fighters. You can later improve the stats of these items by imbuing them with an Asteliary gem. &lt;I&gt; -- Wylfghar 12/28/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I got through it alone fairly easily (level 37).  The boss never left her room so I could shoot her from down the hallway.  Even though I had bludgeon vuln 6 on me she never fired a shockwave at me.  I used greater frog crotch arrows and they worked well on everything in the place.  The place isnt too big so I found my way quickly. &lt;I&gt; -- Moi 4/27/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The New Quest dungeon, full of simulacra, virindi servants, and at the end, The Crafter. Head South if you get lost. The crafter drops the Asteliary Orb, and the Infusing Gem &lt;I&gt; -- Suriel, MT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Located on top of a mesa, there are pathways up the nearby cliffs. Entrance can be hot, foyer is quiet.  Flashy Fire-Red interior decorating, somewhat complex in layout.  Your first greeters are Drudge Raveners.  Similacrea come in Sneaky (about 33rd, meleers), and Subtle (about 45th archer/mages with level 5 war).  Crafter is higher still and much harder to hit. They are radar resistant. Just a few virindi to spice the place up. There is a timer on the orb and gem, perhaps a week. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 9/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Use a Bow on the Crafter and you can drop him in a hurry.  Cuz my 350 UA skill was barely hitting him.. &lt;I&gt; -- Eclipsa 9/20/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Orbs and Gems are scatted on the floor as The Crafter is Camped for his Other loot, anyone who meets the level requirements can walk in an put up both without any problems &lt;I&gt; -- Vo Mimbre 9/23/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subtles are level 60 and drop expensive loot&lt;br&gt; Crafter is level 80.  Timer on orb/gem is longer than one week. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 9/24/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;According to the Sep Dev Chat, the timer appears to be three weeks. &lt;I&gt; -- Asetti 9/28/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To get to the end of this dungeon, take nothing but lefts... youll go up a ramp, then down another.  Once you go back down, go straight on and the Crafter will be in an open room in the middle of the lower level.  She is guarded by several Subtle Simulacra, who appear to have infinite mana (I watched one blast away at a wall between us dozens of times and saw its mana ticker STAND STILL... creepy).  Level 50+ should be able to solo, but I recommend a group anyway, especially if theres no one camping the Crafter. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 10/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The timer is higher than 4 weeks. &lt;I&gt; -- Ga Lee Lea (MT) 10/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The timer is higher than 4 weeks. &lt;I&gt; -- Ga Lee Lea (MT) 10/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The timer is higher than 4 weeks &lt;I&gt; -- Ga Lee Lea, MT 10/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The timer for the Asteliary Gem &amp; Orb is 4 weeks + 1 day -- Just to thwart my test of the 4 week mark! &lt;I&gt; -- Mitsuya 10/17/2001 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This dungeon is the staging point for the New Singularity, the splinter group of rouge Virindi.  In order to access the dungeon, you must bring to Ecorto the Lost Director a Fragment of the New Singularity, which is made up from a Sliver of Singular Pyreal, Obsidian, and Chorizite, gained from 3 separate dungeons. Once inside, you will face a Virindi Masters and Directors as well as Tusker Guards in the beginning areas.  The further down you go, there are more and more Virindi Directors and Executors, Tusker Rampagers, and Terebrous Hollow Minions.  In the last room, you will find Levistras, the Speaker of the New Directive (level 85 Virindi), as well as an absolutely INSANE number of Rampagers, Executors, and Terebrous Hollows.  Make sure you bring a huge group or you wont last very long in here.  Bring HIGH AL ARMOUR or youll be fricaseed by the Hollow Minions. New Singularity Director (Levistras) spawns every 5 minutes or so and drops a Virindi Shroud, a cloak with Impen V, Invuln V, Magic Resist V, and Willpower V.  If youre lucky enough to be the FIRST person on the server to loot Levistras, youll get a unique item called the Shroud of Levistras (same as Virindi Shroud except with Invuln VI and Magic Resist VI). &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now also the home of a portal to Caul Island. Portal is near the entrance. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 6/24/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The third of the Ecortos (and turbines brilliantly thought out completed-in-half-a-second-quest-to-end-a-nine-month-story-arch-quest) dungeons where you must get a sliver off one of the four Singular Obsidian Pillars in the end of the end of the dungeon. First there be Tusker Guards and virindi puppets. Then servants and masters. At the bottom you meet Rampagers, Tumideon Minions and the Director, plus a gang of Masters guarding the Pillar room. The Director drops a Directors Mask. The respawn rate is maddeningly fast, about 2 seconds, and I have spotted many corpses down here already. Mages stick to the rampagers, and meleers make sure to take out them rickety but hard hitting tumideons fast. The antechamber to the pillar room is narrow and will be place for heavy battles. It is possible for a person to break out of the fight, run across the room down ramp and into the pillar room unscathed. In here you can either dash further down and hide at the exit portals, or run up-ramp to the pillars (ramps are at the left and right at the end of the room). You can perch this place in relative safety. The entry portal cant be tied to, but the surface portal can be. &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a good place to level up on Tusker/Virindi. The antechamber to the sliver room is very difficult to negotiate: Guards and Rampagers will block the narrow entrance corridor three deep, and lag will pop heroes in and amongst them, but not let them run through in an orderly way.  Luring the mob out of the antechamber is unpredictable -- they often get stuck on each other.  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 12/11/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level cap removed. This is now a 45+ dungeon. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 7/8/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Dungeon of october 2001 patch. Has the pyreal pillars that one needs to chip off a sliver from, using the chisel given by Ecorto. Toughest foes are Raveners and Innocent Dolls - the rewards is the Doll Leader Charm, a bracelet with War IV and Focus IV. &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Very easy dungeon with level 6 buffs.  My level 34 spear life item guy had no probs even with his own buffs.  The toughest spot (besides the end room) is maybe 4 ravs at once with 2 dolls.  Mostly it is 2 dolls at a time or 3 ravs at a time. Very easy to find end room. I took west hallway and always take the down and North option.  The only place this doesnt work (a large room with those small niches lining the walls) take an east passageway, and then continue with the down and north advice, after you pass three little cave rooms with a mound in the middle of the floor you are at the end. &lt;I&gt; -- Spearit of WE 10/12/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance/Exit is quiet, foyer is quiet. Another austere new school dungeon, but it slower spawn rate than most new school dungeons. Mostly Innocent Dolls and Raveners. Coming to the dungeon from Tufa or Samsur is straight forward. Coming from Al-Jalima will require negoiating some cliffs. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/14/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The final room has a fast spawn of Raveners and dolls, and is much tougher than the approach to it.  Dolls change from Innocent to Pristine. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/15/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level cap has been lifted. This is now a level 24+ dungeon. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 7/8/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>I found this while roaming the mountains.  Its restricted to lvls 35-46 and being only lvl 31 I couldnt get in to check out what was inside.  The entrance couldnt be tied to either 10/12/01 &lt;I&gt; -- Rezal al Malik&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The very best strategy for this place is to put on shadow garb and throwaway shield helm and boots.  Go in with nothing else but your chisel and 5 cheap gems.  Get a level 6 or 7 life buff, which wont help on the Hollow Lugians, but sure will help with the virindi war spells.  RUN LIKE HELL DUE NORTH.  You cnat get lost, just dodge a few Luginas and virindi, and as soon as you get to the room with the chlorozite pillar, go to peace mode and use ur chisel as many times as you can b4 it breaks.  I got 3 pieces this way easy, then LS recall, or be killed by the horde that has now gathered and it killing you.  We also went in with three meleers and a mage, and owned this place.  We got the cool looking but basically worthless death mace, not a bad place for exp! &lt;I&gt; -- Spearit of WE 10/12/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance/exit clear, almost barren (October patch), foyer is clear. The dungeon is as austere new school as you can get: the BDT is straight ahead, to the right and left are flood rooms filled with giga, exta and titus hollow lugians who come running when combat starts. The main path is seasoned with virindi. The chisel comes from Ecorto the Lost Director, near the mage shop in Zaikhal. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/14/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The exit is tieable and summonable. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 10/14/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;LV 46 and i soloed the place easy and made 2.1mil in xp :) &lt;I&gt; -- Cobain of FF 10/16/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level cap is now removed. This is a 35+ dungeon. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 7/8/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Did not go inside, but passed this portal while running to the new tummy town.  &lt;I&gt; -- Kalahan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Olthoi Harvesters and nothing but Olthoi Harvesters.  Not very good XP, but decent loot.  The dungeon itself is really cool looking, with all new textures and effects.  The first levels are empyrean in structure, but at the bottom is a tunnel into a creepy Olthoi hive with unnerving environment sounds... and even further in is a weird swamp cavern with fumes belching up from the decomposing ground.  If youre lucky enough to find a Pincer on one of the Harvesters, bring it to Redspire for some XP and health elixirs. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 10/27/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the dungeon for the Olthoi Title quest. I found a pincer after each spawn at the bottom of this dungeon. It would only allow me to pick 1 pincer up since they are on a quest timer. Return the pincer to Behdo Yii in Redspire to get 2500 XP, 5 treated heal kits and the title Bug Stomper. Overall, an easy quest if you have acid and pierce protection. Loot is level III and IV and in great abundance. Watch out, the Olthoi swarm when you hit one of them. Populated with level 15 Olthoi Harvesters. &lt;I&gt; -- Spunkey Yank 11/1/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance, exit and foyer are quiet. The dungeon is small and somewhat complex for its size&lt;br&gt;  Spawn is fast. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/6/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh.. and the corridors in this dungeon are twisty enough that you can do some wall working. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/6/2001 &lt;/i&gt; Moved to 42.0N, 82.2W in the Pillars of Sand event (June 9, 2004). New exit coords same as new portal coords. &lt;I&gt;-- Lila_MT 6/11/2004&lt;/i&gt; Level restrictions were removed as well. &lt;I&gt;-- Solan Thommad 6/13/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

We are responsible for maintaining the stone rings of this island.  Please disturb not my work, for all depends upon this rhythm.&lt;BR&gt; If you hand him a pyreal bell he will break the ring.

This dungeon has a fair amount of Eviscerators on a medium spawn time (6-8 mins I think), each worth more than 10K xp each.  Tons and tons of high-value loot drop to the floor uncollected (wands and armour above 10,000p are fairly routine) but not too much is keepable.  At the bottom of the dungeon where the spawn is thickest is where the Eviscerator Pincer drops, which is worth 3,000,000 XP in Redspire... make sure you have 12 slots in your inventory free when you turn it in, cuz you get a whole lot of items.  Also try to be in a fellowship with 4+ others when you all turn in your pincers, as the XP magnifies thru the fellowship. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 11/18/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;has anyone figured out how to maximize the xp given from the pincers. More people in the fellowship = more xp? Or do you get more from having a certain number of fellows?  &lt;I&gt; -- Bandaid 12/31/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance and exit are quiet. Foyer is quiet, and a good place for both buffing and getting into a fellowship for maximizing XP while working in the dungeon. Eviscerators attack only low with piercing and slashing -- no acid protection needed, and there are a fair number of bare-chested heros working the place.  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/8/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fellowship XP is at its zenith with 8 people in the fellowship... no more, no less.  Its not such a big deal while hunting, but its recommended when turning in the Pincers.  With 8 people in a fellowship, you get both the 3 million XP from the pincer, AND another 5.3 million XP from your fellows. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 1/14/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;WARNING!!! Buff Acid. As of the Jan 2002 patch Evis now spit acid. Personaly I think they hit harder also. So be warned bane all 3 or have ALOT of melee def or well die. &lt;I&gt; -- Dark Man - Sol 1/22/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Give this rubble to Aun Ngationa in Timaru for a Storm Totem.

    <description>Can not be linked summoned or recalled. Requires DM. &lt;I&gt; -- Dark Man - Sol&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is hot with legionaries on the dam. Foyer is quiet. This is the home of both the third Rusty Chest for making Pyreal Bells, and the Olthoi Queens Quest Shower Room. There is a waterfall at the start -- turn left after jumping to get deeper into the dungeon. The Rusty Chest is easy to get to and in a quiet room.  The Shower Room is a big acid-floored room deep in the dungeon -- it takes teams and lever pulling to get there.  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/26/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Found this dungeon running around Marae Lassel.  Made it a good portion through, full of tuskers, Slaves, Guards, Silver and Armored.  Also Virindi and the new Martinate Hollow Minions.  We had to leave when we were swarmed by a dozen silver tuskers an Executor and about 6 Hollows.  I would suspect this is Martins Lair or a base of his.  Didnt make it to the end, yet. &lt;I&gt; -- SlvrDrgn&amp;Mthron&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Be Carefull!!! Anti-Magic trap there. All my buffs gone so i had to recall. &lt;I&gt; -- Elder Merlin 10/30/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Went back in with a bigger team, made it to the end.  At the end you will find a virindi NPC there. If you give him a singularity weapon he will convert it so that you dont lose it when you die. &lt;I&gt; -- Silver Dragon 1/9/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>After visiting Aun Papileona at 40.4N 78.2W he tells you, Greetings, traveler. I have a grave favor to ask you. In his jealousy, the anima Carenzi has infested the beautiful shrine I built for Raeta with his creatures. I tried to route them myself, but the horrid beasts nearly ripped me to pieces and ate the key to my chest! Until my shrine is cleansed of his defiling presence, Raeta will not return! Aun Papileona tells you, I locked my amulet inside my chest--if you bring it to me as proof that you have driven Carenzi away, I will reward you with the title of Carenzi Slayer. Follow Volkamas riverbanks to the north, and youll find my shrine. (I could not go in, My level was higher then 15) &lt;I&gt; -- Zandor Hansson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dungeon is Aun architecture -- very native. Entrance and exit can be hot with native fauna. Foyer is quiet.  Dungeon is mostly Carenzi Pouchlings (smallest) with about five sentries (next smallest) in the final room -- one of these drops the key to the chest.  The dungeon is medium-small with meandering loops of halls.  Ramp to 2nd level is in the middle of the big room. Aun Papileona will give you a nice Reatas Amulet for returning his -- Regen 2, Rejuv 2, Healing Mastery 2. (Papileona, by the way, is really big on butterflies.) &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/8/2002 &lt;/i&gt;Full name: Aun Papileonas Shrine to Raeta. Moved to 38.9N, 76.3W from 41.7N, 78.3W.

    <description>&lt;I&gt; -- Three [WE]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 70+ restricted.  Deep within the Mt. Elyrii Hive is the Royal Hive, where the Olthoi Queen lives.  To access the Royal Hive and defeat the queen, you must give 1 bell each to the five Aun Tumeroks at the five menhir rings spread out all over the plateau (remember, once you give a bell, you cant get back into Timaru for a month, unless you kill the Queen).  You also have to be sprayed by an Eviscerator at the end of the north dam hive (which only lasts for 90 minutes).  Once inside, proceed to the bottom and defeat the Queen!  Check out Maggie the Jackcats site for more information on this part, as its very difficult and I dont feel like writing it all out here &lt;br&gt;)  Just remember, once the Queens dead, loot her head ASAP or it will be lost and you wont be able to get the quest rewards.  Another word of warning, you cannot log off in here or youll reappear at your lifestone when you log back in... this is to prevent camping though it also punishes people with a bad connection. Once you defeat the queen, return to Timaru and give the queens head to Aun Hareltah for 40 million XP, the title Queenslayer, and a stuffed Queen head you can hang on your wall. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 6/12/2002 &lt;/i&gt;Entrance / Exit is modestly hot with Marescent plateau fauna.  Foyer is hot with Chaos Wisp.  Upper level of the dungeon is accessable without being sprayed, and is inhabited with Chaos Wisps and Legionnaries&lt;br&gt; spawn rate is modest.  Dungeon architecture is spacious with jumps and platforms. &lt;I&gt;-- Doc Feelgood 11/6/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Vault key is found on a Hea Shaman. Add tip to haft to make the Living Spear. If you return the completed spear (Aun Tanuas War Taiaha) to Bachus she gives you 1500xp and 3 stam elixirs. Can opt to keep the spear..ok noob spear weapon 5-12 base +3/+3 w/ Spear Mastery III, SK II, Rejuvenation II. Diff: 40  (no other reqs).

    <description>Buff mainly vs Bludgeon, Fire, Pierce and Slash.  A Chaos wisp attacks upon first entry.  Jump down the waterfall to face 3 Vapour Golems, whilst taking water damage.  Up the ramp is a roomwith 2 diamonds guarding the lever.  Leave a lever puller.  Team fights down through Nobles and Legionaries to an acid-pit run.  Run through pit following left wall and unpick the Olthoi door.  FIght up to a closed (lever) door.  Pull 1st lever to open this door and then wait for lever puller to run down and through to you, if they want a bell part.  Continue up to reach original exit portal, or search after lever door for component of Queens quest bell. &lt;I&gt; -- Nukem/Leafcull&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Turn right after jumping into waterfall for the ramp out of that room -- dont fight under the waterfall unless you enjoy damage.  Much of the dungeon is Olthoi, and the bell part is in a Rusty Chest guarded by a moderately spawning Chaos Wisp. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/26/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Aun Papileona tells you, I locked my amulet inside my chest--if you bring it to me as proof that you have driven Carenzi away, I will reward you with the title of Carenzi Slayer. Follow Volkamas riverbanks to the north, and youll find my shrine.  &lt;I&gt; -- Zandor Hansson&lt;/i&gt; Moved to 39.8N, 76.4W from 40.4N, 78.2W. Now says: Aun Papileona tells you, Greetings, traveler. Raetas migrations are such a beautiful mystery of nature. But where she goes, I must follow. I have moved my shrine to again be near her presence. Aun Papileona tells you, It is unfortunate that my misfortune seems to have followed me in turn. I have a grave favor to ask you. In his jealousy, the anima Carenzi has infested the beautiful shrine I built for Raeta with his own creatures. I tried to route them myself, but the horrid beasts nearly ripped me to pieces and ate the key to my chest! Until my shrine is cleansed of his defiling presence, Raeta will not return! Aun Papileona tells you, I locked my amulet inside my chest--if you bring it to me as proof that you have driven Carenzi away, I will reward you with the title of Carenzi Slayer. Follow Volkamas riverbanks to the south, and youll find my shrine. Aun Papileona tells you, Incidentally, I would be careful going past my old grotto if I were you--a motley group of Hea have moved in and made the place their own. They had an interesting-looking chest with them...but I was in too much of a hurry to follow Raeta on her migration to inquire further.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;I&gt;-- Solan Thommad 6/13/2004&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>The agent of the Arcaneums ENVOY is here, and a quest to get a writ, and lawn dwarf decorations and fountains to buy for houses &lt;I&gt; -- Spearit of WE, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To access the uber furniture store: run past the envoy NPC towards the lifestone, take a left, run a short distance down a couple of flights, and youll find a room with a couple of Goldenback Tuskers, Drudge Lurkers, and 1 Leader Hollow Minion (level 55).  First, kill the minion (you HAVE to take the kill), then pick up the Illegible Note on the floor, and take the note back to the Envoy.  Give the note to the Envoy and youll get a Numudiras Token.  You can either keep the token to give to an Agent of the Arcanum for 1 Writ, or give the token right back to the Envoy to access the furniture store portal in the same room.  I recommend taking the furniture store option, as the quest is NOT repeatable and Writs can be gained in other ways. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 11/17/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Furnature store sells only 3 items at present: Plaques (100k), Fountains (200k), and Lawn Drudges (200k).  These items are only worth 10k, 20k, and 20k respectively, so there go dreams of lawn drudges nerfing death items. :)    &lt;I&gt; -- Eshuun Dara 11/26/2001 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;if you take the first passage to the left and go almost all the way to the end you will find not only more of the usual goldenbacks and lurkers, a tusker slave can be found there. my patron didnt believe me when i told him so i led him to it. spawn was consistant both times i went in there. &lt;I&gt; -- Han Shi 1/09/02 1/9/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Located near Essence of Enchantment &lt;I&gt; -- Skam Jim-One&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This dungeon is part of the Helm of the Elements quest. Top level has Olthoi Soldiers, second level a few Legionaries. The rest of the dungeon contains Glacial Golems and Cold Elementals. Two teams must push buttons and pull levers for each other to advance. The upper group receives a Frigid Bracelet, the botton group an ice prism to be turned in to an Agent of the Arcanum. &lt;I&gt; -- Wylfghar 2/28/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance and exit are quiet. The foyer is quiet only if you take no steps towards the door, otherwise a soldier will come out to greet you. Spawn rate in most of the dungeon is modest. The first part of the dungeon (Olthoi part) is small. There is an acid floor that must be jumped on, but it is easy to run off. Nearby is the chest with the tool. The second parts of the dungeon are the cold parts. These are larger, rambling and part of lever, lever land.  &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 3/24/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Cannot be tied to or recalled to. New as of Fever Dreams patch. Inside there are olthoi soldiers and legionaires for the first part. Remember to get the Fire Hammer before you go into the Upper and Lower Propylaeums at the bottom. Next part is a nightmare of lever pulling. Many of the levers are trapped, which means they are useless and should be avoided. Seems only the levers without traps opens door for the other team. Reward is Incalescent Bracelet and a Fire prism.  &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Around the corner and down a ramp is the Altered and Augemneted Olthio. They hollow electric and acid. I took a 181 point blow on my gloves. NOT a place for a mage to hang out unless you like dieing ALOT. The key part is on the bugs corpses. BRING ALOT of freinds. There is a room with like 20 guys on a 3-5 min spawn.

This is a great spot to hunt the Fire Auroch Hide for the Buadren or the Fire Auroch Bull Horns for the Composite Bow Quests! Respawn is estimated at around 10 minutes.

    <description>First part of the three dungeon Quiddity Ingot quest introduced in march 2002s Persuassion patch. Theme is to go down down down down untill bottom. If you run up, its the wrong way. Foes are siroccos, therals and tsurics, strange combo elementals of ice and fire, acid and lightning. They resist my 349 life magic almost all the time, and my 383 war pretty darn often. And I hit for 20-30 pts. Slashing seemed to work better. Baning all 4 elements seems to be a good idea. One of the therals at the bottom drops a Ring of a Singularity Key. Pick this up and get to next dungeon, Venomous Nidus, for 2nd part of the key. &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Northern raider spawns here sometime after dawn. I arrived in the afternoon and waited all day, all night, and into the morning for the spawn. Bandit castle is just to the north a couple miles, and there is a lifestone on the road SW of the castle. After killing the raider a portal appears. Inside are lurkers, stalkers, and finally raveners. Raider looks just like a ravener. He drops northern quiddity fragment. Sebarek 03.26.02</description>

    <description>In the water, off the beach a ways. Some sort of palace with stone head megaliths making paths to it. No apparent enterance.&lt;br&gt;--Courtesy of Virindi Inquisitor and Blessed Red Flower. &lt;I&gt; -- Garfield3d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The gray temple-like structure is four-sided and may be element related. The stone head nearest the temple is VERY close. If you can get on the head, perhaps you can get in. Regardless, I detected no objects or residents. &lt;I&gt; -- Neko Neko 6/14/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is actually Gaerlans Citadel... on the evening of July 11th 2002, this place erupted in a rainbow of elemental electricity shooting towards the sky as the water surrounding it bubbled with flame.  These recent events come on the heels of the first sighting of Gaerlan who nearly killed Asheron at the Midsong Festival Stone, no doubt foreshadowing the upcoming battle between Asheron and Elysa against Gaerlan and Martine.  Still no way up there, though, besides forming a PK ladder or jumping from the top of the nearest stone head with a 480+ jump skill... &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 7/12/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The palace, now known as Gaerlans Citadel, is no longer in this location.  Having taken flight and migrated SSW, it crash-landed in the mountains far northeast of Holtburg during the Verdict event of Sep 2002, where it now lies.  Accessing the citadel is now part of the Gaerlan quest. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 2/16/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""Traveler. I have a tale to tell and a task I would put upon you. Were you to take this task on yourself, you will bear witness to things I have seen and a wondrous device I glimpsed but could not fathom or grasp.""&lt;br&gt;Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""For you see, there is an artifact in a place unlike any that exists in Dereth.""&lt;br&gt;Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""I am an explorer for the Explorer Society. In a desert region, I came upon a suspended walkway hung out from the edge of a cliff.  The other end of the walkway was attached not to solid ground but was lost in the spinning light of a portal.  I held my breath and stepped upon the walkway, half expecting it to collapse and throw me to the ground so far below. Yet, the walkway held my weight!  I crept forward and stepped through the portal.  I arrived on another walkway, or perhaps the same one somehow extended through the portal.  There was a platform at its far end, then another walkway... Well, it is something you must see for yourself.  Suffice it to say that I journeyed through this structure, all the while being assailed by vile creatures. Near the top of this construction I spied an artifact- a tall pedestal it was, with arcane shapes gyrating in the air above it. I know not its function but it was clear to me that this artifact, this device, is of some import. There are many things it could be and none, I believe, of small consequence! Before I was able to reach it, a wretched monster sent me back to my Lifestone!  Later, I attempted to return, yet the portal would not permit me to pass. I know not why.""&lt;br&gt;Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""I must study this device. I call it the ""Arcane Pedestal."" I even believe I have the means to create a version of it, but first I require an imprint of its morphology.""&lt;br&gt;Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""I shall give you a copy of my notes and an Imaging Crystal. The notes show you the way to that place. The Imaging Crystal can be imprinted with the composition and design of this device.  Return to me with the imprint embedded within the Crystal and I will study it and determine how to create it.""&lt;br&gt;Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""The Arcane Pedestal!  We shall have the Arcane Pedestal!"" &lt;I&gt; -- Astalon Decurth&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the start point for the June 2002 ""Arcane Pedestal &amp; Map of Dereth"" Quest. Speak to Slithe Traddior for an item, then travel to the Precarious Sojourn Portal. You *must* be higher than level 30 for the NPC to issue you a Crystal. -- Nocturne, LC  &lt;I&gt; -- Nocturne, LC 6/22/2002 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>same than the 2 others &lt;I&gt; -- me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The temple at this area is in no way lame! Chomu and Dark Leechs in here..found many +8% mana c orbs in the chests that open with no keys necessary.  The chest that a sik cant open tho, im curious, is this a questor chest?  Also to clarify, this particular small temple is behind the ithaenc temple, same isle as sanctuary.  Perhaps you dont care for this small temple but my bm/65 loves it! Its the toughest small temple I have found, and considering the exp and loot...Im very happy!  Im considering getting a Lady Adjas key to try here considering that its not SIK openable...and on the isle. &lt;I&gt; -- GRIMM 10/22/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Something else odd....I logged out..then back in here, and all the chests now cont be opened.  This place is odd...  However I did get large menos and alot of siks drop here as well. &lt;I&gt; -- GRIMM 10/22/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is guarded with Chomu Sclavi, one of whom blocks the entrance. Chomu, Dark Magus and Dark Leeches inside. Dungeon is one room. Foyer is modestly hot. Entrance and exit are recallable, but not summonable. The small temples are the same layout inside, but different monster mixes. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 12/16/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Entrance portal is a random spawn on the north end of the plateau.  Foyer is quiet.  Individual rooms are large and convoluted, but the overall dungeon layout is simple. There is a big jump to get to the bottom.  Rubble drops from a Level 90 blue Olthoi Noble who will randomly spawn in place of the normal Noble at the bottom. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/26/2003 &lt;/i&gt; Can not be summoned or recalled.  Dungeon is full of Warriors at the top, with a few Mutilators and Swarm Evicerators towards the bottom.  Exit portal at the very bottom after a large jump.  Turn in at Timaru for the Timaru Totem of the Palenqual elder weapons quest.  There is a single Olthoi Noble spawn in a side room at the bottom, which can randomly produce a Level 90 blue Olthoi Noble that drops the Rubble for the North Ring at 53.0N, 73.3W.  Give this rubble to Aun Ngationa in Timaru for a Timaru Totem.  This can be used on the Palenqual weapon or turned into Aun Hareltah for 500k XP.&lt;I&gt; -- Taarna Blood SC&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Entrance is quiet, Foyer is quiet, and it is a staging area for four separate dungeons that are level restricted: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-70, and 70+.&lt;br&gt;Entrance is tieable and summonable, but you must have visited the arcanium research facility south of Zaikhal and collected ten magic decanters before you can enter here.  (Theres a 3-day timer between collecting decanters and completing quest.  If youre not finished, you start over.)&lt;br&gt;There is no surface portal in staging area, and no monsters.&lt;br&gt;The inner dungeons start with a drop, and fighting elemental monsters -- different for each level range. There is a boss golem to kill at the bottom. The BDT here is to fill your decanters with pure mana, which is then used in making Isparian weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are three drops. Each drop is heavily infested with elementals and golems.  But, the spawn is slow -- if you clear a level, it will stay clear for many minutes. The level area after each drop is small but there are some pseudo respite areas were you can stand and control the rush at you.&lt;br&gt;You can fill decanters before the boss golem is dead -- click high on the waterfall, rather than low. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/6/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Correction: you can enter without decanters, for, say, a corpse rescue. But without decanters, you have nothing to fill. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 12/18/2002 &lt;/i&gt;Updated level restrictions/portal names/element:&lt;br&gt;20-39 - Fathomless Chasm Devex - Cold&lt;br&gt;40-49 - Fathomless Chasm Clough - Fire&lt;br&gt;50-59 - Fathomless Chasm Plummet - Acid&lt;br&gt;60-79 - Fathomless Chasm Descent - Lightning&lt;br&gt;80+   - Fathomless Chasm Abyss &lt;I&gt;-- Neros 10/25/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Entrance, exit and foyer are quiet. Portals cannot be recalled, summoned or tied to. Dungeon is linear and long, long, long. Tuskers of 41st and 61st, and Tusker Minions of 32nd level crowd the halls. Spawn is medium. There are some trappy places. The eye candy respites between the long corridors are nice. The souvineer shop at the end is appropriately tacky, and quiet... a good wind down place. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/14/2002 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Until someone makes a map, if you make a right turn at every intersection, you will wind up at the Emporium at the bottom. &lt;I&gt; 11/18/2002 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Monoculture dungeon, pure Liberator (61). Dungeon is medium small in size. The layout of the first part is symmetric and ""O"" shaped. The spawn rate is medium. Exit is at the far end of the O, take the ramp up. BDT is a Liberator Tusk on a tusker in the last flood room before the exit -- worth 75K and a recall gem. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 11/27/2002 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;I&gt; -- OmniTek&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance and Exit are hot with local fauna. Dungeon is pure Rampager, with Rampager Tusks dropping at the two exits. Layout is the same as Tusker Abode: a long, winding, statue-lined central hall with ""U"" shaped side corridors. Halfway through is a pit to jump in, with a bridge to land on. If you don't land on the bridge, you have to recall out, unless you can jump out. (A good jumper can do that.) After the pit, the dungeon ""twins"", and exits and tusks are available on either side. There are several debuff traps, in particular in ""debuff corridor"" about a quarter way through -- bring your creature-enhancing magic stuff. (Rampagers are hollow hitters, so protect magic isn't going to do a lot.) The Rampager Tusk is worth 6% of the XP for your current level. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 1/3/2003 &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inside the dungeon there are heads you can jump on to cast safely. The lava at the bottom of the pit is safe to swim in. Also, Rampagers aren't hollow hitting, so protections and impenetrability will help a lot. &lt;I&gt; -- Garfield3d 1/20/2003 &lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <arrival_longitude>0</arrival_longitude>
    <description>Yes this is a random dungeon, yes there are allready a billion and one entries for it, yes I am apolagising for entering another one, but I tried several times to add to the Floating City (Primary) thread and managed only to put in one line... so here is what I was trying to say, assuming this adds itself. There is far too much speculation and roumour on this thread, so, since I know virtually everything there is to know about the city, let me set a few things straight. Firstly, portals may now be tied and recalled to, they cant be summoned but if you see one on the landscape, tie to it, and camp it for any friends who may want to tie too (random portals only disapear when the landblock resets, so if your watching the portal it wont go anywhere). Secondly, there is no pattern to the portals apearing, they are RANDOM! Thirdly, multiple portals can spawn on the surface, the city is broken up into 8 different landblocks (7 called The Floating City, and one The Golem Sanctum), and I think all of them can be created as random landscape portals. I think the golem sanctum only spawns in the dires but I cant confirm that). Thus all these reports saying when you enter go this way are useless because it all depends on which part of the city you have entered. Now, when you enter the city, your first step is to do a /loc and work out which landblock your in, then before jumping off anything or going through any portals, check ACMaps.com which has maps of the city (done by yours truely). So far Ive only done 6, Im waiting on the random portals to take me back to the final two landblocks. That raises another point, many of the portals between the different parts of the city are random as well, which is why you should tie to the first one you found, as you may not be able to get back to explore more. Inside the city, all exit portals, and lots of the internal portals (all helpfully called just The Floating City) are random, but unlike random portals on the surface, they are allways in the same place, but every month (on patch day) they change their destination. On the maps I have made all portals are identified as either stable or random, stable portals all have a return portal next to them to facilitate two way travel. Lockpicking is not required, but does make a little more of the city accessible, it is I believe posible to get everywhere by random portals but random portals are of course random. The toughest door is resistance 322, and worth picking if you can because it leads on to a stable portal to another section. There are what apears to be two significant points of interest in the city, one is the golem sanctum, an absolute labyrinth of tightly twisting passages and more junctions than I can count, all filled with Iron golems, and at the end one obsidian with a dispell trap and a chest of crap loot. The other point of interest is something everyone should see at least once in their life, a floating advocate tower in the direlands (3.7S / 69.2W), about as high above the ground as the tou-tou lighthouse is tall, and with a bright pink energy fountain inside it. On top is a random portal to the direlands somewhere. At the begining of the Golem Sanctum is a stable portal back to the city, and a random direlands portal, I have seen these portals go to North Direlands Valley Junction, and my old favorite hunting ground North Direlands Land Bridge. During this months patch I also found a portal whos name and location I didnt write down, but the drop was so hot I died before I materialised. Shortly after that they did a server rollback and the portal changed again. Within the city you will find a number of Strained Books, which cannot be picked up but give you some interesting lore about the place, and some interesting insights into the Empyrians past. In all I would say this whole place is priety much a place only to come if you like exploring and lore, the monsters inside are for the most part, low level undead and a few banderlings, there are 2 virindi servants, and 2 revanants, and thats about it for the high level monsters. However, it does make a wonderful alternative to the Abandoned Mines as a subway, because while the portals change every month, there are a lot of exit portals and they drop you in often rare towns like Kara. A few non town portals spawn, but rarely, and all Ive noticed is Heartland which has to be one of the most common random portals (and the most boring). Anyways, Im begining to ramble on without really saying much, so I will just say that the floating city is a great place to visit, and a nice place to tie to and use as a subway (incidentally the exit portals can be tied to and summoned, so when you find a Kara portal, take a copy of it for your guild, its a nice quiet town that sells level 6 scrolls for those rich enough to afford them). Should anyone be interested in learning more, go take a look at ACMaps.coms maps and post a message on this thread, I look at it occasionally, alternatively if your on harvestgain, just tie to the city and use it to get arround, Im sure well bump into each other there (tho its never happened yet, portals in are VERY rare).

    <description>Home of the fantastic floating circles and floating tower.  Come here for the wallmap of Dereth, and to fill your Imaging Crystal.  Normal way in is by using the Precarious Sojourn Portal, but, the valley can be run into from across Direlands wilderness, and if you have a ferocious jump, you may be able to hop onto one of the circles from a nearby cliff.  Spawn at the top of the floating tower is very fast, and the undead loot is good. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Singularity Recall Scroll dungeon.  This portal cannot be recalled, linked or summoned.  Dungeon is large, dendritic and filled with locked and levered doors.  If youre after the scroll, bring a good lockpicker and a couple lockpicks, this person will be busy. Inhabitants are many kinds of 100-115 level monsters -- some mage nasty, some melee nasty. The quest takes a long time, bring buff capability.  You can log out and log back in here.  The eye candy is good, so dont rush your way through.  The dungeon consists of several parts, and a map is a big help.   You can also obtain one of 3 level 7 quest rings from the key guardians of each section. &lt;I&gt; -- Astalon Decurth -- Doc Feelgood &lt;/i&gt;

    <description>There will be four main dungeon sections: each in sequential order&lt;br&gt;Tusker Warriors Lair&lt;br&gt;Tuskers Food Storage&lt;br&gt;Legend of Tusker King&lt;br&gt;Throne of the Tusker King&lt;br&gt;Inside are Assailers, Devestators, Annihilators (a few), Reapers, Obsidian Chittiks and Tusker Sycophants, not to mention dispel traps and Tuskers Gift traps. Many different sections on the way down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; -- Astalon Decurth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the realm of the legendary Tusker King, Oolutanga (a.k.a. Bobo).  He is located in the Throne of the Tusker King part (the 4th part).  Talk to him to get portaled to the prep area for the final battle with Mowen Udaun, a huge level 900 tusker who flattens the unwary without a second thought.  Buff in this little room, but dont go thru the next portal until youre ready as the drop is hot.  Like Gaerlan, you dont need to kill him to get your reward (just register a hit on him) and once hes dead, take the portal that spawns and youll wind up back at Bobo.  Hell give you a monkey paw with one wish (or if you got the kill on Mowen, it has 3 wishes) - take the paw to the treasure room portal and use it on the tusker statues inside.  The Item Enchantment one the Recall Aphus Lassel spell directly into your spellbook, and the others give you XP towards an indicated skill.  The Greed statues will fill your packs completely with I, X, or M notes.  The person with the 3-wish tusker paw can use three statues.  The funny thing about Oolutanga is that he appears as an object (white arrows around him when clicked and IDd), could this just be an elaborate ruse...? &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF 2/6/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>North of OP. New monsters, densely populated. -- Astalon Decurth&lt;br&gt;This seems to be a main entrance to VoD. Hunting parties often form up here and occasionally the Tremendous Monongua is near by. Mahogony and Oak chests spawn in the area. Critters in the area to the North often measure their health in thousands of HPs. Resistances and regen rates are high. Suggest only the strongest of players or fellowships made up of level ~80+ characters venture into this area. -- Dei Ray &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This dungeon is found in the basement floor of Ulgrims Cottage on Ulgrims Island, which is accessible by either using Ulgrims Recall Spell or giving the Drunken Madman in the tower near Baishi a mug of Winter Lager bought from the barkeep in Nanto.&lt;br&gt;When approached, Ulgrim will ask you to fetch him a mug of his special Home Brew in his basement.  Enter through the portal in his basement and marvel at the amazing array of decorations on the walls and floors, probably the most impressively decorated place in all of AC.  Some of the items are recognizeable, some arent, some are unusual (like Ulgrims vast collection of monster heads), and some are just silly (like the Holy Handgrenade of Antioch, specially imbued with the Rabbit Slayer property).  This dungeons worth seeing just for the decorations, if nothing else.&lt;br&gt;There are many items to get in this dungeon, the primary one being the Home Brew.  Take the Home Brew to Ulgrim (dont drink it -- 14 day timer!) and hell give you the Casting Stein that has a mana C bonus of 7% and also casts Stam to Mana IV.  While killing your way through the dozens of tiny white and brown mice (which respawn like crazy and have extremely high attack skill, even though they do little damage), youll randomly find a Golden Key, which unlocks all the locked chests and doors in the basement.  All locked chests and doors are easily pickable, as well, so the key is not necessary for LP characters.  They also sometimes drop a block of cheese, which is ironic as its 50 times the size of the mouse carrying it.&lt;br&gt;The Golden Key can be used on either of Ulgrims storage chests, in which one can find the Hangover Cure, an Ust, Stout, Winter Lager, and Peppermint sticks.  Alternately it can be used to unlock the Treasure Room door which is hidden behind a wall of tapestries near the storage chests.  Behind the Treasure Room Door is a room full of glittering piles of Treasure (worth 200k and hookable on floor hooks -- 28 day timer), a Golden Gromnie inscribed by Ulgrim (no timer, but unusable for purchasing mansions), and a Lock Box that contains a simple gold ring inscribed by Ulgrim with the message Lo Bnaseuim (28 day timer).&lt;br&gt;Upon returning to Ulgrim, you can give him almost any item found in his dungeon and hell say funny and witty things, most notably doing his Gollum impersonation when you give him the gold ring.  Also, if you give him the Peppermint sticks, hell give you a Peppermint Pumpkin Pie that drains 20 points of stamina when eaten. &lt;I&gt; -- Confucius of FF&lt;/i&gt;</description>

First part is jumping down levels. Second part is a portal maze. (the ""path book"" story contains clues to the proper sequence.) Third part is mazey, left hand rule works well. Inhabitants are a wide mix, including: Augmented Drudge, Virindi Observers, Slave through Silver Tuskers, and Terebrous Hollow Minions. There are two Virinidi Executors, but they don't have to be fought -- just run by them. BDT is a Signet Ring dropped by any of several Virindi Inquisitors (90th) at the back. Good eye candy through out.   &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 5/22/2003 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;You cannot enter this dungeon without speaking to Syltyn Rylyn in Glenden Wood first.&lt;i&gt;  -- Immacolata 5/25/2003&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There's a timer on how often you can do it.

    <description>The charred, arrow poked remains of one of the shadow spires that menaced Derethian cities (and citizens) years ago. It lies in a huge crater, much like the one in Arwic where another Shadow Spire destroyed the old city. This is a spot where you must take your vassals on Sight Seeing. Afterwards you can head up to the watefalls for some fishing. &lt;I&gt; -- Immacolata&lt;/i&gt;</description>

There is a way up! You must complete some quest in order to gain access to this dungeon. Inside lives Asheron. Speak to him and receiv a book about the olthoi menace. The book is hookable. &lt;br&gt;To get in you must do the Knorr Academy quest first, I think. Everyone I spoke to in the dungeon had completed the Knorr Quest. Those who didnt could not get in. When you speak to Asheron he mentions that he is aware that you have been through his other estate (Knorr). You cannot get out though! Must recall it looks like. &lt;I&gt;  -- Immacolata 7/23/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This tree can be clicked on. If youve done most of the Lost Husband quest that starts in Ayan Baqur with the NPC named Aaminah, it will portal you into a dungeon with 4 trials. The first is a Lockpick trial which requires you to have LP and have it buffed pretty high (300+) or else it will drain away your health. The 2nd is a room full of rolling balls of death with wood platforms hovering above... you must jump from one to the other without falling or youll die and your corpse will be 100% unrecoverable. The 3rd is a room with a target on one end, you on the other, and a lava pit between. Use a bow, xbow, or wand to strike the target with a critical hit. The last room is a rather difficult logic puzzle, which might possibly be bugged (4 of us did it and our answer we all arrived at separately was wrong). Look it up online and avoid a lot of frustration :) Solving this takes you to a room with the new Oswalds Dirk, possibly in a pickable chest... I didnt make it this far because of the bugged puzzle, so I might be wrong on where it is. No word on where the lost husband really is, though, or why Ulgrims acting so guilty. -- Confucius of FF &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance is mildly hot. Dungeon itself has nothing to fight -- its a jump-and-puzzle dungeon. If you fail the first room puzzle and survive, heal up and try again, theres no timer on trying the puzzle.  There are several chests in the final Dirk Room, some are pickable. Just entering this dungeon flags you as ready for the follow-on quest, Heart of Innocence, and there you learn the lost husbands fate. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 8/9/2003 &lt;/i&gt;</description>

They spawn every 5 minutes and the bits are on a 24 day timer. Even further down is a Queen that I didnt get to meet. The bits that are dropped can be given to the olthoi hunter in Arwic for fine armor pieces.&lt;i&gt; -- Immacolata 8/22/2003&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Entrance and exit are hot with local fauna.

    <description>Inside cave guarded by Wild Monouga &lt;I&gt; -- Zen Tek Ken&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This appears to be a duplicate of the Carved Cave west of Stonehold. Entrance is hot with a slow spawn of Wild Monoguas, foyer is quiet, exit takes you back out near entrance. (so this is not an alternate entrance to the Stonehold CC). Two keys are needed to get through the locked doors that are between entrance and bottom where the portals to Dires (near Candeth Keep, +21st level), HOLL dungeon (no level restriction) and Q-bar are located.  Both keys are in unlocked chests that are in the dungeon. &lt;I&gt; -- Doc Feelgood 8/23/2003 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Carved Cave dungeon portal west of Stonehold doesnt exist anymore so ignore the top part that relates to it. &lt;I&gt; 8/24/2003 &lt;/i&gt;Please check out some information about... &lt;I&gt;--  2/11/2005&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Non-random -- GM Entrance is not summonable or recallable. Haliana settlement out of Craigstone is a good choice for a nearby portal dropout. Entrance is hot with local fauna. Foyer is quiet. This place is large and rambling with jumps as well as ramps. Spawn is thick and fast in places, and getting jammed is likely in those places. Top is Soldiers and Nobles, deeper in Evis and Swarm Drones are added to the mix. The Matrons and Queens at the bottom are bigger, tougher, and regen very quickly -- very difficult to solo. There are two each. This is the low level version of the Olthoi Armor quest. -- Doc Feelgood</description>

    <description>Entrance is lodged in the base of El Badasso Rift -- approach from the south (subway) or northwest, or have a really hefty jump. You must be flagged by picking through the backpack at Lugian Encampment before you can enter. (17.1 N (near Zaikhal) 4.8 W).  Bring an M-note for bribing foyer guard.  Entrance/Exit is hot with Lugian guards (50-70), Foyer is quiet.  Top part of dungeon is medium in size with straightforward layout -- door to Olthoi section is to the right on the first fork.  Lugians and Tumeroks (50-80) guard first section, density and spawn rate is modest.  Door to Olthoi section can be attacked to open it.  Olthoi spawn behind the door is THICK.  A good way to fight it is to beat the door down, then run back down the corridor to the first bend.  Olthoi will follow, but reluctant to fight that far from their spawn area. &lt;I&gt;-- Doc Feelgood 10/31/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>A fairly straightforward, if not excessively long and boring dungeon, this place gets you the Living Tome, a cool floor-hookable furniture item.  Inside are all Falatacot Consorts, Patricians, and Matriarchs, more and more the further you go in.  Near the bottom, you know youre going the right way if you go down some spiral staircases.  At the end is the Falatacot Abbess, whos level 161 and has 4000 HP.  She doesnt drop anything of note, but beyond her is the Living Tome, which you just use to get your own.  No camping needed.  Respawn is quick, though, and theres a LOT of them, so I recommend bringing a group of at least 4-5 uber players, if not a small army.  Their swords and spells do a lot of damage, so bane for all physicals and buff your acid or bludgeon weapons.  When this quest first debuted, you could give the living tome to Nuhmudira for a global and a book of lore, but then she leaves. &lt;I&gt;-- Confucius of FF 11/7/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This is the dungeon for the elemental weeping weapon quest... &lt;I&gt;-- Spoiled (Darktide) 11/29/2003&lt;/i&gt;The drop is not safe, but there is a handy pillar to perch on right inside that is safe for buffing. Youll see four tunnels downward, each glowing the color of the elemental pool youll find. This place is filled with level 100 tiny gromnies that do elemental damage. They hurt, even through banes. Theyll attack as soon as you are inside. I was able to run through the dungeon and convert four weapons to each element. I didnt bother killing the gromnies, I just healed a lot. The exit portal takes you to the other side of the hill, as if you had passed through. Each tunnel has an exit portal at the bottom. &lt;I&gt;-- Geomancer 12/16/2003&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This dungeon has several levels to it, each with a different level restriction to it. I believe there may be a note to pickup at every portal entrance. The first one had one so far. It goes all way up to lvl 100+ area that at end has a undead npc. &lt;I&gt;-- Zen Tek Ken 12/18/2003&lt;/i&gt;Entrance is quiet&lt;br&gt; foyer is quiet.  Spawn is a mix of Undead and Olthoi. Dungeon is large and meandering, and divided into sections by portals.  The portals are at the back of each section, and in front of each portal is a note that can be turned in to Xavier for XP.  Sections are level restricted 20+, 40+... up to 100+.  The portal for each section is tieable and summonable, *but there is no going back portal* so you cant get back into a lower level section. Spawn rate and monster level increase as you go from section to section. Its a nice place for leveling and looting if youre tired of pure Olthoi and pure Tusker dungeons.  (Note: the note you pick up is no-drop/no-give... until you have it translated by the Zaikhal translator.) &lt;I&gt;-- Doc Feelgood 1/14/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>This dungeon seems to have gotten lost from the database when it was moved near Zaikhal.  The portal cannot be summoned, and has no level restriction anymore.&lt;br&gt;The following is copy and pasted from the old entry for Carved Caves.  If this is already here, forgive me, it didnt come up with a Search.&lt;br&gt;Near Stonehold.  Last key in quest for the SoLL is found in chest at the bottom.  MANY monsters.&lt;br&gt;Now lvl 17+&lt;br&gt;has lots of monugas, a few skels and some shadows at the bottom -- Ki Dung Sa Bong 10/18/99&lt;br&gt;Near the end where you find a key .. green portal to Direlands .. -- Frescobaldi 12/20/99&lt;br&gt;Main chamber with the SoLL key is guarded by 3 Shadow children up front and 3 Shadows near the chest containing the key.  Portals to Qalabar and Midland Direlands in the same chamber. Portal to Direlands sends you to a lifestone near the middle of the southern coast.  Portal to Hebian-to is nearby. -- Farouk 1/26/00&lt;br&gt;Addition:  Level 15 for Westward Portal to Carved Caves, Level 17 to get into Carved Caves, Level 21 to take portal at bottom to mid-Direlands.  Portal restricting at its finest.  -- Doc Feelgood 2/6/00&lt;br&gt;Does anyone know how to get there? -- Lost &amp; Confused 3/12/2000&lt;br&gt;You need to get carved keys to get down to the Soll key - once youve found the 2nd surface portal, your virtually on top of the shadows. Theres also a chest, that req a sturdy iron key with the Skeletons in the Monouga Gallery - 30/6/00 -- Typhoid V 6/30/2000&lt;br&gt;The chest with Sturdy Iron Key spawns level V scrolls. Useless since SplitPea.  -- Nekorkhan (MT) 7/9/2000&lt;br&gt;Note that the portal cannot be tied to nor summoned. Tie to the Murk Warrens, about 8 clicks away, instead. You can reach the surface portal of that dungeon (just take a right) without fighting. At the Carved Caves, be ready for the Shadows in the end. Be careful, or they may draw you into the Qalabar portal. You will definitely want to take the Direlands portal from this dungeon to reach the Halls of Lost Light.  -- Wylfghar 12/28/2001  &lt;I&gt;-- Solan Thommad 1/17/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Added during the October 2003 ""Reign of Terror"" Patch. Originally restricted to levels 60-90, the upper level restriction was removed with the November 2003 Patch.  Dungeon contains Virindi Executors &amp; Profatrix, a variety of Shadows, and some Tuskers. Inside is a altar that gives out the ""Bracelet of Dark Essence"". A quest item that is actually useful!  The spells include MAJOR Stamina Gain, MAJOR Health Gain, and Willpower VI. Respawn here is fast but not insane. Should be able to reach altar easily in one buff cycle (much less if you know your way around). This Dungeon is one part of the three-part ""Preparation for the Ritus"" Quest. &lt;I&gt;-- Ally McAlchemist 11/20/2003&lt;/I&gt;</description>

    <description>Use the Odd Looking Vine at bottom the temple to teleport you into the dungeon. &lt;I&gt;-- ZTK 3/10/2004&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first in a series of Fellowship quests.  The level breaks are 40-69, 70-99, and 100+   Puzzles and trials lead to the High Matriarch Ixir Zi.  One of your felowship members must be the Victim who uses the 4 Eyes to bring the Matriarch out.  The Eyes massively debuff the Victim and continually drain them.  I believe the draining only starts when they have 0 stamina.  I strongly suggest that the victim logs out for the duration of the battle.  They have 15 minutes to rejoin and will be much safer.  Make sure to have a couple people wait in the Boss room to refellow and Heal the victim.  Send the rest of the people into the reward room to battle the few Burun present.  Afterward your Victim may enter, but make sure that they wait out the debuffs before getting their reward.  The Sarcophagus casts a drain spell as it gives you the Ancient Armored Vestment.  You then have a choice of an Axe, Sword, Mage Staff, Thrown Weapon Brace, Crown, and a Mansion Portal to Kivik Lirs Temple.  &lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 10/14/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

There is a door at the front of the fort that can be attacked. It is best to do it from a distance since the lugians dump hot oil on anyone near the walls. Once the door is broken down, rush inside and jump into the center pit area with the buildings. Toward the back there is a head with a portal inside. Toberik is in the basement area of the building to the left of the portal. A room with boxes has a hole in the ceiling and he is hiding up there. Take his note back to Krank in Linvak Tukal to be flagged for the Noble Weapons quest. 
&lt;br&gt;The note is aparently givable. I dont know if this is intended or not. &lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 9/26/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>10M xp pincer spawns on the mutilators in the red room &lt;I&gt;-- Seeker 6/9/2004&lt;/i&gt;restricted to level 80+ &lt;I&gt;-- Seeker 6/11/2004&lt;/i&gt; Current coords are correct. Quest url added, map url corrected. &lt;I&gt;-- Lila_MT 7/2/2004&lt;/i&gt; If you see this with coords of 0,0 in Oracle of Dereth it means that somehow youve got it in your locations.loc twice. Open locations.loc in notepad, find Mutilator Tunnels and look for the entry with the 0s for coords. Remove that entry.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Changed the name of this dungeon in an attempt to get rid of the Oracle of Dereth bug&lt;/i&gt; Don't bother marking this entry suspect, it's meant to be named like it is.</description>

I planned to meet my beloved, Aun Mariona, but I am afraid that my Hea brethren have learned of our romance and are watching over me. Could you take her this note? I dare not go meet her myself, lest they slay us together. You will find her in the redwood groves almost directly north from the city your kind calls Bluespire. I have written the directions to our meeting place on the note.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;His note claims Aun Mariona is at 41.1N, 74.4W.  She is, of course, not there but her brother Aun Bernawa is. &lt;I&gt;-- Solan Thommad 6/13/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>A Dungeon using new technology for the enterance, similar to Xarabydun. There are two buildings at this location. One of the structures has only one door, but inside there are two.  The inside of the structure is larger than the outside. The second door leads to a dungeon.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dungeon is filled with various high level undead and golems. Near the bottom, guarded by a litch Opressor and a host of undead is an SSK chest and a Runed chest (300 LP).

    <description>Darktide Festival Stone Portal Located in the dires sub which is inside the hut and at the bottom of the dungeon. &lt;I&gt;-- Chupon 8/12/2004&lt;/i&gt; This is my own entry. When seen in ACExplorer, it loads as a festival stone, not a portal. Not sure how to fix this as all the other portals I added for dires sub worked fine :(&lt;/font&gt; &lt;I&gt;-- Chupon 8/16/2004&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; I found that by adding a space to break up the word Festival, ACExplorer suddenly honored the location type again. I can only assume that this is a design decision made by Zugg for AC Explorer, since its present in ACExplorer 2.2 and Pro 3.3. --Geomancer 8/26/2004
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; needs exit coords&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>These Dungeons dont show up as portals or items, but any 3rd party detectors will call them Vile-Smelling Refuse.  You must be flagged to enter by giving Captain Krank in Linvak Tukal Toberiks Report.  This report comes from the Renegade Fortress at 28.5S,65.5W.   
&lt;br&gt;Beware of the fume damage floors here.  They can do 40ish dmg per second.  Ramps are always safe.  Fairly straight forward, just go down. This dungeon contains a Ruuk Shaman Watcher at the bottom.  Upon its death you will get a green message, and the Ruuk Shamans with Morgluuk are reduced in number and spawn.&lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 10/30/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>These Dungeons dont show up as portals or items, but any 3rd party detectors will call them Vile-Smelling Refuse.  You must be flagged to enter by giving Captain Krank in Linvak Tukal Toberiks Report.  This report comes from the Renegade Fortress at 28.5S,65.5W.   
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Morgluuks main dungeon.  Beware of the fume damage floors here.  They can do 40ish dmg per second.  Ramps are always safe.  Go here after you have sufficently weakened his forces by completing some of the other dungeons.  The Egg slaying dungeon weakens him, and the other 3 subtract from his forces.  I recommend that you at least slay his Egg.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once inside this dungeon, head West and then take the SW fork.  Go down until you reach a corridor with passages to the sides and 2 large burun at the very end.  Dont go down the corridor, go right at the bottom of that ramp and find another ramp going down.  Morgluuk is down the next slanting tunnel you come to.  If you did not get rid of some of his guards, they are on a very short spawn.  There is a damage fume floor at the base of Morgluuks ramp.  It is best to have one person try to lure him onto the ramp for the battle. &lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 10/30/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

&lt;br&gt;Beware of the fume damage floors here.  They can do 40ish dmg per second.  Ramps are always safe.  This dungeon is short but brutal.  Lots of Fume damage floors here.  Many Burun eggs are scattered about, but the one you want is way at the bottom in a large room.  It is always in the same spot, among a group of 4.  Most eggs are easy to kill, but this is a true tough egg.  After you kill it a green message appears saying you weakened Morgluuk.  This halves his HP and reduces his skills, stats and regen.  If you do no other dungeons to weaken him, do this one for sure.&lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 10/30/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Dungeon at the bottom of Xarabydun city sewers.  Entry to the sewers and portal is blocked by a locked door with 82 diff.  Portal restricted to levels 1-25, but can be Tied and Summoned.  At the bottom of Uninhabited Area Portal is a portal to the Lightless Tunnels, also 1-25.  In order to get to the Lightless Tunnels portal, you must find a key on a Mite among a room full of mites.  This key unlocks one of 2 doors into a room with a locked door alcove.  In this alcove is a chest, with a lore text, and a lever.  The lever is placed so that you can use it through the door without opening.  This lever opens the door in the room with the mites which leads to the Lightless Tunnels. &lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 11/8/2004&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <description>Only accessable to characters 1-25.  Reached by going through Uninhabited Area Portal and then into Lightless Tunnels.  There is a Mid Direlands Portal at the bottom of a 40 damage pit here(with Bludge pro 7 and 110 jump)  It is Tieable and Summonable, restricted to 18+.  This exits at 37.1S, 65.9W and is actually the Valley of Death hot drop, which is very hazardous for any lowbie that goes in.   This is a good place for your new portal mules to get a VOD portal while they pick Crystal Nodules.   &lt;I&gt;-- Taarna Blood SC 11/8/2004&lt;/I&gt;</description>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;using this sign in Zaikhal fills your mind with thoughts, starts you gesturing and entices you to start a quest.... &lt;I&gt;-- Seeker 1/3/2005&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Give me the hide.

You've earned 10,000 experience.

Yi Yo-Jin gives you Hoary Mattekar Robe.

You give Yi Yo-Jin Hoary Mattekar Hide.

Yi Yo-Jin tells you, Yes, the Hoary Mattekars are now back.  Given the strangeness of creature migrations that have occurred over this past year, I would not be surprised were the Hoary to be a more permanent fixture on Dereth.

Here is your robe.

Old Text:

I came here long ago in search of the lengendary Hoary Mattekar. Alas, but I no longer hear its roar in the night. I wonder if it shall ever return to Dereth?

Still, I will tke your creatures' lesser hides and craft them into useful items for you.

If you give Yi Yo-Jin a large mattekar hide or normal mattekar coat, he will re-work it into a lovely fur variation. This lovely coat is highly valued by the Aluvian ladies.</description>

Alean the Steel Forger tells you, Also, if you wish to color your new Greater Shadow Armor, you may buy a vat of color from my assistant. If you do not like the color, please give me the armor piece and I will replace it with the standard piece which you may then choose to recolor.</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Impious Staff.

While excavating this site, I inadvertently awakened the undead that rest here. I was able to escape the dungeon with my life, but before doing so I found a large audience chamber with treasure. 

Offer me any trade note worth 5000 pyreals and I'll give you access to the dungeon. In return, you can keep anything you find in there. I can use the trade note to further my investigation in this site. From what I was able to uncover so far, I believe this area was once a place used by powerful Gharu'ndim War Mages. 

Any relics you find may be difficult or impossible for you to use. Perhaps, if you are skilled in Gharu'ndim War Magic you may be able to understand what I could not. You can't go down there if you're not level 20, in fact I wouldn't go down there if I were you. Just forget the whole thing, you're better off that way.</description>

Ya-Bint-Al-Hawa will give you a reward of Peerless or Treated Heal Kits in exchange for Mnemosynes.

Hello. Myself and my brothers-in-arms have been assigned to exchange gifts with those that donate undead trophies to the Shagar Zharalim.

The literal translation of my name means daughter of the wind. I adopted it in honor of my mentor, who recently disappeared during a journey to Uziz.

There are healing kits even more potent than the ones dropped mainly by Lugians. The Zharalim have recently uncovered lore that enables them to treat these kits in order to make them more potent. If you trade me a memnosyne [sic] fragment, I will reward you in turn, depending on the quality of the fragment.

You give Ya-Bint-Al-Hawa A Large Mnemosyne.

Ya-Bint-Al-Hawa gives you Treated Healing Kit.</description>

Hello. Myself and my brothers-in-arms have been assigned to exchange gifts with those that donate undead trophies to the Shagar Zharalim.

I realize that it is dangerous to hunt the more potent Sand Kings without protection. With the proper gift, I have been authorized to grant you a gem that can disperse such maladies.

There have been many strange occurrences in the desert recently.  On occasion, there are sudden sandstorms for no reason.  It is very odd...

You give Anid Al-Fadee A Large Mnemosyne.

Anid Al-Fadee tells you, "Thank you. Here is your reward."

    <description>Quest(s): Mnemosynes.

Greetings, outlander. I am Saelar of Menilesh.  My master, the great Tennar Portheran perished during the Fourth Sending, along with so many of our people.  But before he died, he set in motion a way for our people to preserve our heritage and our memories in the face of the recent catastrophes that have befallen the Dericost.  He invented a number of Mnemosynes, devices that allow us to record our stories and lives in these little pyramids.

Tennar commissioned a locksmith from among your kind, whose name I do not know, to make these Mnemosynes lockable and to make keys to the Mnemosynes which only Tennar would possess.  Unfortunately, I have no idea what happened to the lockpicker or his keys.  The Mnemosynes have been coming in, and I have no way of opening them.

But still, if you come across a Mnemosyne please bring them to me and I will reward you well.  The collection for the larger Mnemosynes I have tasked to my assistants whom can be found through the portal.

    <description>Good day to you!  I am Bartholomew, though my friends call me Bart.  After I get set up here, I'll start taking certain items and making them into furniture.

There's nothing finer, than wares made by Steiner!</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Delving into Claude's Mind, Masks.

Hello, my name is Leopold!  It is awfully hot out, is it not?  Good thing I am wearing short sleeves!

Leopold tells you, "Greetings. I am a member of Claude's pod. It is good to meet you. The environment is pleasing today, agreed..."

Leopold tells you, "Do I seem less exultant than normal? I confront two issues, comrade. Claude has returned, yes, but is now more independent than before. I worry that if the Singularity were to find out, Claude would be reabsorbed or worse."

Leopold tells you, "I also find myself increasingly thinking of myself as separate from the Singularity. How can this be? Do you understand, comrade? How can I have a desire above that of the Singularity? I suppose you might. It is the nature of this place to distance us from the Singularity - to slowly cause us to lose our connection and sanity."

Leopold tells you, "You cannot help me, but perhaps you may function to help Claude."

Leopold tells you, "His consciousness has been closed to me. Please, if you can unlock it and discover the error in his mentality, do so." 

Leopold can help you repair a Broken Virindi Mask, should you find one...but can he be trusted?</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Palenqual's Living Weapons.

Aun Shimauri tells you, We alone among the Tonk have been blessed by Palenqual. In her wrath against Wharu, she has given us the weapons that live to fight against him. Find one of our totems on the Hea, and I will reward you with the friendship of the Aun.


You allow Aun Shimauri to examine your Hea Totem.

Aun Shimauri tells you, I`m sorry, friend, but this totem is obviously of Hea craftmanship. See its inferior carving? The totems I am seeking to restore to my people are made of greenstone, opal, and obsidian. And further--even though the Hea have demeaned themselves by stealing from us, I cannot accept something that belongs to them. You should take this to Aun Hareltah--our Tah will know what to do with it.</description>

You will find her at the base of the Marescent Cliffs, almost directly north from the city your kind calls Redspire. I have written the directions to our meeting place on the note.</description>

I don't know where this new Mattekar is rumored to be, you would have to ask Britana.  I have to admit, I had never encountered a woman like Britana before back in my home village.  She is quite the woman.

After September 2005
Mazur ibn Stounis tells you, Have you any word of Britana? I can barely sleep at night, my heart is sick with worry for her. Varicci's men dragged her off solely because of her brother! And now I am told I must aid this Eliza woman or share Britana's fate! I tell myself that I can do Britana no good imprisoned, but... at any rate, I will still aid you in the crafting of robes.</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Raeta's Necklace.

Aun Papileona tells you, Greetings, traveler. I have a grave favor to ask you. In his jealousy, the anima Carenzi has infested the beautiful shrine I built for Raeta with his creatures. I tried to route them myself, but the horrid beasts nearly ripped me to pieces and ate the key to my chest! Until my shrine is cleansed of his defiling presence, Raeta will not return!

Aun Papileona tells you, I locked my amulet inside my chest--if you bring it to me as proof that you have driven Carenzi away, I will reward you with the title of Carenzi Slayer. Follow Volkama's riverbanks to the north, and you'll find my shrine.

(Starting point for the &lt;a href=http://ac.warcry.com/compendium/quests/index.php?action=display&amp;id=75&gt;Raeta's Necklace&lt;/a&gt; quest.)</description>

If you bring me a small bundle of feathers from the Kithless Siraluun that roam the island, I will ask Siraluun to help me make a special headdress for you. Even better, if you combine the five of the smaller bundles into a large one, I will make a lovely dress. Here, add the bundles to this special bag, it will keep them from getting rumpled."

Aun Whethura the Crafter gives you Emproidered Bag.

The Emboidered Bag will allow you to safely store Small Bundles of Kithless Siraluun Feathers to be crafted into a fine Siraluun Dress.  He also takes single bundles to craft a Siraluun Headress.</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Aun Tanua's War Taiaha.

Bachus Flufens tells you, A visitor! I do not often get many visitors to my modest homestead. Did Micon or Lark tell you that I've been spending time with the Tumeroks? A most fanciful folk, I must say! Why, just the other day one of the Hea told me about a legendary spear they dismantled and enshrined in two separate parts of the island. It once belonged to a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to persuade them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. Somehow they dispatched him but retained his spear...which is supposed to have some sort of magical, living properties to it. I'm not quite sure what to believe.

Bachus Flufens tells you, Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns to the northwest along the shore.  Try the area around 44 North, 87 West--at least that's where I saw my new Tumerok acquaintences heading last. Beware, friend--it sounded as if they held this artifact in high esteem, and it's quite likely to be well guarded. I'd go myself, but I must catch up on my journal today. If you would like to read it, here are a few pages that I wrote the other day.

Bachus Flufens gives you Bachus Flufen's Journal.

After September 2005

Bachus Flufens tells you, Woe is me! As if it were not bad enough that I was driven out of my farm to the west by the Hea, now Varicci has taken over my town! Fortunately Micon and I are safe, but I must say that it has made it very difficult to continue my work.</description>

Behdo Yii tells you, Hello there stranger!  I am wondering if you can help me in a bit of a predicament I find myself in.  I was busy exploring a wonderfully well-preserved abandoned Tumerok outpost, when I was beset upon by a number of Olthoi!

Behdo Yii tells you, I had never seen these fearsome creatures that close before, and the fact that I escaped with my life leads me to believe that these Olthoi aren't quite so tough as their mainland counterparts.  If you could journey to this tumerok outpost and rid it of these troublesome beasts I would be most grateful.

Behdo Yii tells you, If you could bring me back some proof that you have conquered them, such as a pincer, I would reward you well.  The portal into the dungeon is straight north of here, the Abandoned Tumerok Site.</description>

He says he's been reformed, but I can spot a bandit when I see one! Townsfolk say they've spotted shady-looking guests coming and going from his house at odd hours. Could you check on him?

    <description>Quest(s): The Moars, Nuhmudira's Boon.

Hiro, Arcanum Artificer surveys you with the scrutiny of a jeweler appraising a fine gem.
Hiro, Arcanum Artificer tells you, "I see that you are an adventurer of sorts. I find most adventurers to be fools. But ... you have helped Nuhmudira. That makes you a noble fool, at least."

Hiro, Arcanum Artificer sighs.

Hiro, Arcanum Artificer tells you, "If you assisted Balthazar and you obtained a necklace or gorget of sorts, then be quick -- hand it to me."

Hiro, Arcanum Artificer tells you, "If you have not, perhaps you had best go see if Balthazar and the High Queen's Royal Guard need your help in getting the job done in Lin. Though I wouldn't put much faith in the woman, or anyone loyal to her. Don't look so surprised -- not everyone follows the High Queen blindly. I think that our recent contact with Asheron is an affront to Nuhmudira."

Hiro, Arcanum Artificer raises an eyebrow and studies you grimly.

Hiro, Arcanum Artificer tells you, "No ... I do not believe the lies that are spread about Nuhmudira. But you are welcome to your own opinion."</description>

MacNiall the Unruled tells you, "Arrr, and welcome to MacNiall's Freehold. Have ye seen them funny statue things the Mosswarts like to worship? I thinks their eyes is kinda pretty. Bring me one, and I'll see what I can do to reward ye."</description>

If you seek out the Arcanum Tinker in the Consortium near Xarabydun, he will be able to tell you more!"

Arcanum Researcher tells you, "Meanwhile, I will still deliver the same rewards for any trophies that you might find on the statues menacing our towns. I will give additional rewards for any interesting items found within the Foundries, for I am sure the Arcanum would be interested in studying them further."</description>

Ecorto the Lost Director says, "Oh, we're not united any more than you are."

Ecorto the Lost Director says, "I was with the renegades... no use trying to hide that... but I disagree with some of the things they are doing..."

Ecorto the Lost Director tells you, "Greetings, human. Call me Ecorto. I have disjoined myself from those who plan your eradication because I disagree with their methods. Their plan to construct a New Singularity in this realm is madness. Even now they gather and imbue material to construct their monstrous dream. Find the repositories of the New Singularity in the desert, the southern mountains and the Obsidian Plains, human."

Ecorto the Lost Director gives you Ecorto's Chisel.

Ecorto the Lost Director tells you, "Take this chisel, scrape slivers from the pillars they assemble, and bring the joined elements back to me... Be careful, however. The Singular material is quite strong, and could break the chisel."</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Arcane Pedestal.

Slithe Traddittor tells you...

Traveler. I have a tale to tell and a task I would put upon you. Were you to take this task on yourself, you will bear witness to things I have seen and a wondrous device I glimpsed but could not fathom or grasp.

For you see, there is an artifact in a place unlike any that exists in Dereth.

I am an explorer for the Explorer Society. In a desert region, I came upon a suspended walkway hung out from the edge of a cliff. The other end of the walkway was attached not to solid ground but was lost in the spinning light of a portal. I held my breath and stepped upon teh walkway, half expecting it to collapse and throw me to the ground so far below. Yet, the walkway held my weight! I crept forward and stepped through the portal. I arrived on another walkway, or perhaps the same one somehow extended through the portal. There was a platform at its far end, then another walkway... Well, it is something you must see for yourself. Suffice it to say that I journeyed through this structure, all the while being assailed by vile creatures. Near the top of this construction I spied an artifact- a tall pedestal it was, with arcane shapes gyrating in the air above it. I would know not its function but it was clear to me that this artifact, this device, is of some import. There are many things it could be and none, I believe, of small consequence! Before I was able to reach it, a wretched monster send me back to my Lifestone! Later, I attempted to return, yet the portal would not permit me to pass. I know not why.

I must study this device. I call it the Arcane Pedestal. I even believe I have the means to create a version of it, but first I require an imprint of its morphology.

I shall give you a copy of my notes and Imaging Crystal. The notes show you the way to that place. The Imaging Crystal can be imprinted with the composition and design of this device. Return to me with the imprint embedded within the Crystal and I will study it and determine how to create it.

The Aracane Pedestal! We shall have the Arcane Pedestal!</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Flags.

Verdentine Magnan tells you...

I am afraid I find the recent Grievver activity in this valley somewhat unsettling. They seem to guard the area against all other creatures. Ive never seen Grievvers build a nest, but I think thats just what they are doing. Perhaps the lack of Shadow infulence for so long is allowing them to return to a more natural existence. If you think yourself brave enough I would be very grateful to know what they are doing in the far east of the valley.

I am very interested in insect trophies and body parts. You can learn much about a creature from its remains. If you have any I would greatly enjoy looking them over. Dont worry Ill return them after Ive examined them. I do however have a powerful appetite and cannot make the same assurances about food. Haha!

This I know for a fact. The Grievvers cannot abide the presence of Olthoi. They will fight fiercely against them whenever the two come in contact. This leads me to believe that the Grievvers and Olthoi share some common origin.

Did you see that? A little Grievver! I wonder if its a different species or just a juvenile.

I believe that the Grievvers have a complex social order. I can often see one deferring to another in combat or during feeding. Yet it doesnt appear to be a purely physical hierarchy since Ive seen a smaller Grievver receive deferential treatment. Perhaps they also recognize intelligence or magical ability as dominating traits. Its all very interesting!

No, I cant have a campfire. It might attract the Grievvers. Small price to pay really.</description>

Frest Greevling tells you, Traveller, please! I wonder if I may call on you to help me? An unnamed evil permeates my mansion. I cannot go back in there! There are some objects of sentimental value I wish to have retrieved from my house. I will reward you if you do.

Frest Greevling tells you, I shall give you a copy of my journal in which I have recorded the growing horror within that house. It also lists the items I would appreciate you retrieving for me. Also, if you should discover any clues of what is causing this horror, please bring them to me.</description>

Tiffany Comfore tells you, Welcome! Here you see the beginnings -- the fragile embryo -- of the future art community of Dereth.

Tiffany Comfore tells you, We are here, my two fine friends and I, to prepare for peace! After all the recent hubaloo, we believe that Dereth is in for a long and glorious Golden Age of Art, in which all Derethians everywhere will forsake their violent ways and instead take up the gentlest and most noble of sciences: alchemy, cooking, and fletching.

Tiffany Comfore tells you, We are at the forefront of this artistic revolution, leading the way, dismantling the roadblocks, smoothing the path for the mass of humanity behind us! We live to serve!

Tiffany Comfore tells you, We're gathering converts every day, every minute! If you would like to join us, you can start by trying your hand at crafting. Just take an old, disused item that is of no worth to anyone -- for instance, gromnie teeth! -- and fashion it into a beautiful and useful object of art.
Tiffany Comfore tells you, Then bring it to one of us, and we will reward your efforts.

Tiffany Comfore will reward you for any Gromnie Tooth Paste you may have.</description>

    <description>Quest(s): The Blind Snowman.

Blind Snowman says, I'm not dangerous. See? I'm smiling.

Blind Snowman tells you, I was standing in a meadow minding my own business, taking in the scenery, when BAM I get whacked with something from behind.

Blind Snowman tells you, Shoom! Shoom! Both my eyes go flying from my head and I can't see. Then I hear two distinct voices. One was chiding the other to apologize and the other one was laughing all crazy and mean. The mean voice said that was the funniest thing it had ever seen and to shut up or it would do the same to the nicer voice.

Blind Snowman tells you, People these days! If you see my eyes around would you please bring them to me? I would be very appreciative.

You give Blind Snowman A Lump of Coal.

Blind Snowman tells you, What's this?

Blind Snowman tells you, Wohoo! Thank you! I'll be able to make a new set of eyes once this gets cold enough!

Blind Snowman tells you, You deserve a reward for your good deed. Let's see... well not see per se... one second.

The Blind Snowman scoops up a pile of snow and casts a spell. The snow coalesces forming ice crystals that shift and rearrange as if alive.

Blind Snowman gives you Snowman Snowglobe.

Blind Snowman tells you, I can't be sure it turned out exactly right, but I hope you like it.

Blind Snowman tells you, May your bottom stay cold and your eyes stay put. Soon I'll be able to see the snow again!

Blind Snowman says, Much more of this and I'm going to become an Unhappy Snowman.

The Blind Snowman swallows the Lump of Coal with a contented smile.

Blind Snowman says, Who's there? I..I've got an icicle!

Blind Snowman tells you, People these days! If you see my eyes around would you please bring them to me? I would be very appreciative.

Anasha tells you, Greetings. I am a student of Nuhmudira.  Nuhmudira is delving into the lore of Lifestones. She has sent me to enlist the services of Isparians in obtaining some rare compounds and crystals. Several types are important to this research- Iolite gems,  Chrysoberyl compound and Daichroic crystals.

Anasha tells you, If I could impose on you to deliver this Iolite gem to my colleague Aun Paritea he can tell you where to obtain the Chrysoberyl compound and the Daichroic crystals. To find Aun Paritea, go through the Tia-Leh Homestead portal which is in the Hebian-to settlement portals array.  Aun Paritea is just south of the Tia-Leh Homestead.  When you obtain them, please bring the Daichroic crystals to me and I shall reward you.  I wish you safe tidings.

Anasha gives you Iolite Gem.</description>

 Student tells you, "Hello. I am a student of Nuhmudira. Nuhmudira is still enlisting the services of Isparians in obtaining some rare compounds and crystals necessary for her research into Lifestones. Dark Tree Crystal and Valara crystal are critical to this research."

Student tells you, "If you could aid us in this endeavour we would be most grateful. To obtain Dark Tree Crystal you should go to a mine northwest of Fort Danby. Then, bring the Dark Tree Crystal to an ancient Empyrean dungeon we are using as a storage warehouse. It is located northeast of the Eotensfang Cottages settlement- you may journey there via the settlement portals near Arwic. A fellow student at that location can portal you into the facility. Give the crystal to the person overseeing the warehouse. I wish you safe tidings."</description>

Astara Duskshield tells you, "Hello. Have you seen Tamian Wilmit around at all lately? I have not seen him in quite some time now. I am concerned about him, he had been acting a bit strange lately. He is a very dear friend. If you could find where he is I would very much appreciate it. He had a row with my friend Delton Hardor. Very out of character for Tamian."

Astara Duskshield tells you, "Have you found anything out about Tamian yet?"

Astara Duskshield tells you, "No word of Tamian? I suppose not, I spoke with most people here myself. I know Delton is still angry at him. Well, Tamian acted a bit wild that day when he and Delton fought, but perhaps he is just not used to swordplay and grew furious when Delton swatted him. Delton is quite good with a sword. Tamian knows nothing about them."
Astara sighs

Astara Duskshield tells you, "Of late, Tamian had been extremely interested in something a Scribe who was travelling through here had given him. It had to do with a tower. Tamian is always drawing towers and such. The Scribe was named Tian Li Quan and resides in Lin, I believe. Tamian is no great traveler and that is quite a way from here. Strange that he would go and say nothing, but perhaps..."</description>

Delton Hardor tells you, "Have I seen Tamian Wilmit? Strange fellow he is, not very able. Seems he can do nothing. I do not understand why Astara is still friends with him. Tis true, they knew each other on Ispar when younger but he is of no use here. Little in the way of useful skills, he has."

Delton Hardor tells you, "Yes, you may go tell Astara I said so. He tried to fight me in sword practise. I swatted him finely for he is no good with a blade and he came at me like a rabid Carenzi. I had to give him a good thrashing, lucky he is we were using wood, not steel. Astara made me stop, also screamed at him, he slunk away like a drudge."

Delton Hardor tells you, "I believe the last time I saw him was over by Ji Tenxien the Tailor. You could ask her."

Delton Hardor tells you, "Do not bother me about Tamian any more, go talk to someone else about him."</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Sword of Frozen Fury Quest.

This mage, located just outside of Glendon Wood, seems to know a great deal about the frozen sword in the dais located within the town proper. Perhaps she will give you clues as to its origin and how to free it from its chilly home.

Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, Hello. I am Mage Syltyn Rillon, a member of the Explorer Society. Perhaps you are wondering about the sword on the dais in town. I had been a friend of Martine's back on Ispar.  I encountered Martine here, during one of his mad rampages. He knew not who I was, nor did he seem to care and the encounter ended badly for me. Upon arriving at the Lifestone I was angry, yet understood that the Virindi were principally at fault for causing Martine's actions. I became determined to help fellow Isparians combat the Virindi and other perils of this harsh land. With the help of Omaro Nagate the weaponsmith, I crafted a frost sword that should be of good utility to adventurers who are skilled in the ways of the blade.

Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, To obtain this weapon you must first prove your worthiness. There is a Virindi complex north of Bandit Road. I left a note on a tree along Bandit Road, east of Neydisa Castle, marking the location where you should turn north. Go to the complex, navigate through it and bring to me a Virindi Signet. I shall then allow you to take the sword.

Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, Oh, take this.  It will aid you in your journey through part of the complex. Read it carefully.

Mage Syltyn Rillon gives you A Tale of Paths.</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Halls of Knorr, Collegium Occultus Ring , The Knorr Quiddity Seed.

Olcris seems to have knowledge of how to get to the old Empyrean Knorr Lyceum. Perhaps if you were to give him some money, he might fill you in on some details or even provide a way to get there.

If you have never been to the Knorr Lyceum before he will ask you for an M Trade Note in exchange for a Knorr Portal Gem. You have to talk to him before he will exchange a trade note for the gem.

Note: You can only get 2 Portals Gems every 2 days from Olcris.

If you have previously been to Knorr and talked to Arikas, Warden of Knorr you can hand Olcris an MMD Note in exchange for a Seat of Knorr Portal Gem. If you do this you can skip the riddles you would normally have to answer to get to the Seat of Knorr.

Talk to Arikas, Warden of Knorr every time you use a Seat of Knorr Portal Gem. That flags you so you can get another gem from Olcris the next time you want to go back.</description>

Tazal al-Ashfai tells you, Hail, tarveler. It is pleasant to meet anyone here in the wastes. Tell me, have you discovered a crypt in these regions called the Burial Temple?

I have heard that the dead walk there, and one in particular carries a certain black gem I seek for my research.</description>

Oh, man! You can help me! My beloved Putiputipuh, she`s not very happy. She needs special onga from where I found her!

I dropped my stuff in the hidey hole where I found her. It`s all the way to the east, straight east from here, right until you hit a BIIIG wall.

I set up a magic portal to the hidey-hole. Here, I`ll give you the password.

Thanks for your help!

Tekapuapuh gives you Tekapuapuh`s Note.</description>

Black Hill Collector says, "There are others who will reward differently for the same items I collect. Not all types of monsters carry trophies, and of those variants that do, it's very rare."</description>

Undead Mechanic tells you, "You should thank us, Isparian! Was our help not instrumental in orchestrating the retreat of the Ancient Olthoi Queen? But I do not expect good manners from your kind."

The undead studies you coldly, then nods. Undead Mechanic tells you, "Regardless, the machine parts that your people have brought to us have been efficacious in our recent efforts to ... in our recent efforts. Therefore, we will continue this program. You no longer require our poison, so we have found other rewards."

Undead Mechanic gives you Missing Mechanisms.

Undead Mechanic tells you, "This text details the parts we will need. At one time there were stores of these parts cached about the land, but now, with the chaos of the times and your meddling, intrusive ways, Isparian, who knows where the parts may lie?"

Undead Mechanic tells you, "But find them, and bring them to me, and I will reward you."

You give Hiyp the Toad Hiyp the Toad's pickaxe.
Hiyp The Toad looks at you with a sodden expression
Hiyp the Toad tells you, "Hey, that's my best pickaxe! I must have left it down in the, ummm, where was that... oh yeah there was that mine, I was tryin' to get some of those crystals them's in Zaikhal wanted. Maybe it'll help with the bugs, maybe not. Well, there's nothing in that mine, I'll tell ya. So I said to myself, forget it, go have a drink. You trying to get some too? Hmmm, I just may know someone who can get some. There's a jeweler, name of Djusufa bint Huqis, she's in Zaikhal. I know her a while, she told me something interesting. One night a woman came to her and handed her a strange crystal, wondered if she knew what it was good for. The jeweler, she didn't know, never seen one like that before. She said she'd have to ask around, maybe check with one of Nuhmudira's people. Well, this woman gets all nervous and just leaves. Anyway, that's all I know. Go see Djusufa bint Huqis."</description>

Robert tells you, "You should have seen the look on his little rabbit face when he tried to bite into it. Guess he wasn't used to ice carrots. Funny little critter."</description>

The good and kindly mayor of Frost Haven.  Should you help him he will deputize you with a nice frosty badge.

The Mayor tells you, "Hello there, hello there!"

The Mayor tells you, "I'm Mayor of Frost Haven. Welcome to our humble little town."

The Mayor tells you, "Normally it isn't this quiet, but we've been having a bit of a problem."

The Mayor tells you, "Have you seen that mountain peak to the North? That's Mount Ingot, a homicidal Magma Golem named Scold lives up there. Every few weeks he emerges from his cave and marches down the mountain to stomp all over our town. Oh the snomanity, oh, it's awful!"

The Mayor tells you, "On top of all that, there's an Abominable Snowman tromping around the mountains and he doesn't like us non-abominable types."

The Mayor tells you, "Oh! You have to help us. He must be stopped. If you don't help us I'm afraid we may be doomed. Doomed! Doomed!"

The Mayor tells you, "Umm, I'm sure I could dip into the slush fund for a reward if you stop him."</description>

You think, "The guard went on. This was beginning to look like an interesting proposition. The capital cities, eh. Who knows maybe they'd provide me with a little insight. I weighed the possibilities and thought about visiting this Dame. But first I needed to find out where she was hiding. The sign in the capital cities was my only clue."</description>

Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, "You must have seen the sign. Please sit down."

Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, "I'm so glad you came..."

You think, "They were always glad. It meant that they no longer had to shoulder the weight of what they knew alone. Camaraderie came from such knowledge. She kept talking and I was having trouble listening."

You think, "My mind kept drifting away to other thoughts. She talked fast, like the buzzing of bees around the first flower in spring. I was doing my best to keep up with the conversation but...there was too much. After a moment or two, I didn't care anymore. I got comfortable..."

You think, "The Dame kept going, talking about some man. Maybe in green armor, with a green dagger or something like that; I didn't care anymore. Her voice was grating on my nerves, like cheese drawn over a cheese grater. I shifted and got really comfortable."

You think, "The Dame was worried. I felt like I should stand up, clear my throat, tell her everything would be fine. But that would mean she'd sob."

You think, "Too late. The buzzing sound of her voice gave way to delirious talk about assassination. I pretended to listen and leaned forward..."

You think, "Then it ceased. It was like opening a Singularity Chest to find three perfectly matched dual major armor pieces, each enhancing a skill I possessed. But like every dream, it ended. Reality smacked me in the jaw, like a Peerless Drudge catching me with my faceplate up. The droning pitch of her voice returned. I got comfortable and listened to the rest of the Dame's tale."

Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, "...and that's why I need you to help me."

You think, "I stood quickly. Better she thought I had heard everything that she had to say, rather than tell her the truth. I crossed my arms and gave her a stern look."

You think, "Before I could think, I said 'I'll do it.'"

You say, "I'll do it."

You think, "She gave me a clean towel..."

Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Clean Towel.

You think, "...a trade note for my trouble..."

Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Trade Note (100).
You think, "...and a location..."

Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, "The last spot we knew he could be found was off the road in a copse of trees, north of Nanto."

You think, "I didn't have to ask what to expect there. Like I said before, Dames were always trouble. I was knee deep with this one."

Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, "Thank you, again."

You think, "The kiss was a nice touch. Though it left me with a sinking feeling. Like getting caught off your guard when the Hopeslayer asks you a question. Never peeve the 24 foot tall Lord of Darkness, you might find yourself falling from the top of the world and believe me, you can't see your house from there."

You think, "I weighed my choices and decided what I needed to do. The entrance to the place would be hidden amongst the trees, but I'd find a way in."</description>

Alaine the Apprentice tells you, Hello! If you are willing, we have a task for you.

Alaine the Apprentice tells you, The Arcanum lost some important research when Martine raided our Research Facility near Al-Jalima. Martine seems to be gone now, but his minions remain, preventing us from retrieving the decanters we need.

Alaine the Apprentice tells you, If you can go there and find the decanters, then you can journey to the Fathomless Chasm, a wellspring of pure mana, and use the decanters to collect the essence there. This essence is required to forge the new pyreal weapons, which we are calling Isparian.

Alaine the Apprentice tells you, Here -- I have literature that explains all this.

Alaine the Apprentice gives you Isparian Arms.

Alaine the Apprentice gives you Treatise on Essence.

Alaine the Apprentice tells you, The locations of the Research Facility and the Fathomless Chasm are written on the flyleaves.</description>

Han Rin-Jo, Jojii Adherent tells you, "In my life, I have seen a great many wonders that have challenged my beliefs, and driven me near the edge of forsaking all that I had known. But in Jojii, I have found the virtuous path."

Han Rin-Jo, Jojii Adherent tells you, "Not so long ago, another came to me. He was as accomplished as you, more so perhaps. What he had accomplished is not as important as what he had learned."

Han Rin-Jo, Jojii Adherent tells you, "His name is Honshu Takeda, and he has begun to learn about himself and the way of Jojii. He had lost his way, and I have set him back upon his path. He will follow the shrines to Jojii. The first lies within this very town, just beyond those doors between the trees."

Han Rin-Jo, Jojii Adherent tells you, "His journey will end in Kara. Much wisdom can be garnered by following the path and incorporating the lessons of the four stones in your actions."

Han Rin-Jo, Jojii Adherent tells you, "Should you wish to follow in his steps, seek the shrine and pray as I am sure he has done."</description>

The last of the adherents on your journey.

Miko Li, Jojii Adherent tells you, "Though I try to live my life according to Jojii's path I sometimes find that I lack discipline. I have begun painting, and hope to continue doing so. I have noticed that many who come here seek the armor that is wrought by Koga Hideki and his peers."

Miko Li, Jojii Adherent tells you, "I wish to assist those who wish to bring the colors of the rainbow to the armor he makes. If you hand me vials of Lapyan, Hennacin and Relanim dyes, I will make them into paints that will stay upon the shadow armor that has been enhanced with the new magical shards."

Miko Li, Jojii Adherent tells you, "You seek the power of the dragon, as did Honshu. Very well. I shall tell you were he was sent. In the valley, across the stretch of land, and water. Through the hills that bite, atop the crest where the sun sets, there is a portal into the place where the Dragon's flame smolders in a basin of metal. Honshu went there to find the Dragon's power."

Miko Li, Jojii Adherent tells you, "Go there and find the strength that I hope he found."

Miko Li will also exchange Vials of Dye for Pots to dye Sharded Shadow Armor.</description>

Honshu Takeda tells you, "You have done well to find the power of the Dragon."

Honshu Takeda tells you, "You have done well to find the power of the Firebird."

Honshu Takeda tells you, "You have traveled the same path as I, and learned the lessons of the great spirits. Now you must know how they fit together."

Honshu Takeda tells you, "The base is the Dragon's power. The grace of the Unicorn must be spread within. The splendor of the Firebird can be placed atop the combination of strength and grace but...only with pure water that represents the four stones and the path of Jojii can you bring the object to life."

Honshu Takeda tells you, "Here, take this."

Honshu Takeda gives you Pure Water.

Honshu Takeda tells you, "The water can be used to waken the combined spirit of the three, or to awaken the strength of just one. I would advise against waking just one. There is little that can be finished that is not complete."

Honshu Takeda tells you, "You have completed your journey. Allow time for the teachings to be set within your being. If within one month you are still without direction, follow my path again, and I shall teach the steps anew."</description>

Aurten Rhell tells you, If you can find any information on the strange incidents occurring on the plateau, I will reward you.

Aurten kneels down and opens a nearby pack. He tilts the pack so that you can see what is inside and then quickly pulls back the pack from your sight and closes it.

Aun Arenura the Crafter gives you Embroidered Bag.

Aun Arenura the Crafter tells you, "...full of feathers, I will craft you a gown of feathers. I should warn you though. I am not skilled enough, nor am I worthy of working with the feathers of the more powerful Siraluun. You should bring those feathers to my father in Timaru."

Aun Arenura the Crafter tells you, "One final note, unlike my father and the others who reside within the walls of Timaru, I bear no grudges to those who may have acted against the Tonk. My father would say that I am foolish for this belief."</description>

    <description>This vendor deals in misc. odds and ends. Its a fair spot to stop if you're in need of basic supplies but not worth a special trip.

There's also a decent sized population of reedsharks, water and mud golems, and the occasional blue wasps about, making this isolated vendor a fairly safe place to hunt.</description>

Gersan the Sureshot tells you, "If you can find a gem more powerful than a mere scintillating gem, I would be interested in it. Give me such a gem and I will use it to craft a magical bow for you. The bow will be so powerful, in fact, that normal ammunition will not work on it. You will have to come to me for arrowheads as well. If you have one my old missile weapons, I will improve it for you."

Gersan the Sureshot tells you, "I am not a crossbow maker, however, so if you need a crossbow you will have to attach a stock to the bow yourself."</description>

    <description>Here, on a remote beach on the west shores of Dereth, these farmers eke out a meager existence.  Things have gotten even worse since the September 2001 event, Keep Your Enemies Closer -- the area is surrounded by a wide variety of Dires spawn: Olthoi Soldiers, Harrower Grievers, Panumbris and Umbris Shadows, and other nasties!  A nearby portal takes you to Plateau, just a stone's throw from Plateau Village.

Oh, and we may not forget to mention the Cow!</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Horn of Vigilance.

Coron Usgin tells you, "Hello harried traveler. Is thy residence threatened by Olthoi or other vermin? Then thou art in need of the Horn of Vigilance! I have been commissioned by the famed Isparian Researcher Telk the Addlepated to sell instructions for this device that he has spent decades developing. The merest breath of wind blowing through this instrument produces a sound which is not discernible by human ears, yet repels all manner of vermin! It also makes an exquisite decoration for any residence!"

Coron Usgin tells you, "Such a fine instrument could easily be sold for 999,999,999 Pyreals, however I will provide you with everything you need to craft it for a mere jar of Sunflower Oil! For one single jar of Sunflower Oil I will provide thee with a beautiful, leather bound, instruction book describing the easy to follow crafting steps for making the astounding Horn of Vigilance."

Coron Usgin tells you, "But hark! There is more!"

Coron Usgin tells you, "For no extra fee at all I will give thee an extremely useful carving knife which thou may use to craft this item! This knife alone has a thousand and one uses! It can carve arrowshafts, cut meat and chicken, chop cabbage, filet fish, slice mushrooms and carrots, cut bread and even carve a pumpkin! Is that not extraordinary?!"

Coron Usgin tells you, "Thus, I strongly urge thee to hurry, pick a Sunflower and bring it to Lilly of Glenden Wood. She will make thee some Sunflower Oil which thou should bring back to me. It is just that effortless! One may find Sunflowers in forested areas of North and South Osteth."

Coron Usgin tells you, "When you return I will tell you about other items required. Good hunting!"</description>

    <description>Quest(s): Liltha's Lost Bow.

Eldrista the Adventurer tells you, "No more scrabbling in dungeons for me! If you want some of Lilitha's dirty old arrows, you can go get them yourself!"

Eldrista the Adventurer tells you, "What? You want the story? Well, just west of here is a dungeon called Hunter's Leap. You'll find it around 35.7N, 32.6E. Legend has it that the great hunter Lilitha lived there when she was younger, while she practiced her skills."

Eldrista the Adventurer tells you, "I never met her myself, but I have a lot of respect for someone with that kind of spirit. Anyway, when she moved out, she left behind a lot of the bows and arrows she had made -- substandard work, stuff she wasn't happy with. But it's still better than what most of these so-called archers can make today."

Eldrista the Adventurer tells you, "I made my living for a long time by collecting the arrows she left behind and selling them. But then the banderlings moved out and a new bunch moved in and my Farmer left and ... I just don't think I want to do that anymore."

Eldrista the Adventurer tells you, "But ... if you find one of her old bows, bring it to me and I'll see what I can do for a reward."</description>

Londigul Ellic the Armorer tells you, "We've driven the Viamontians out of town and back to where they have their blockades setup. Travel down any of the roads leading out of town to find the blockades and kill the invaders you find in that area. If you can kill twenty of the invaders I'll make you a member of the Glenden Wood Militia. Once you've proven you can fight we have more that you may be able to help us with."</description>

Crumpled Note on the floor.

As long as I am writing you, I will answer your question about the distant Carved Cave.

Start at Zaikhal, the proud capitol of the Gharu nation, and journey south for some distance. You will come to a great range of hills -- I can scarce call it mountains, though some flatlanders might. Here, in a low-roofed crevice, you will find the entrance to the Cave. Remember that you must have the other six keys before you venture through!

If you need more explicit directions, send a message to me and I will try to be more clear.

Grievver's set up camp here in PY14 during the The Hall of the Tusker King event. They now stand guard over a runed chest which, so they say, contains valuable treasure within.</description>

    <description>This point of interest consists of a small hill populated mostly by low level skeletons (mostly Warriors). At the base of the hill lies a statue of Bael'Zharon surrounded by many bones. Traveling up the hill you will find to carpeted with bones and some Skeletons. At the top of the hill you will find more bones and skeletons as well as a large Empyrean style head with a green mist surrounding it.

Lore:

This is actually the Battlefield of Ayn Tayan where the various undead factions banded together to fight Bael'Zharon and give the Asheron and the other Yalaini Mages time to construct their crystal array trap for Bael. The battle raged for three days was a victory for the undead because they were able to hold off Bael long enough for the Yaliani to complete their trap but the undead forces were completely devastated by the battle. During this battle the Sand King Anadil managed to destroy one of the original Shadow Spires.

The four Cairns and the green mist mark where the Sand King Nerash was slain by Leikotha who fought on the shadows side in order to get vengeance against Nerash for turning her into an undead. Another lore figure that died at Ayn Tayan was Jaera who was killed by Bael'Zharon himself and who's tomb is now found at the Mage Academy.

Notable lore figures that fought in the battle were:

Aerfalle
Anadil
Bael'Zharon
Geraine IV
Isin Dule
Jaera (Killed)
Leikotha
Nerash (Killed)
Rytheran

The best source of lore about the battle at Ayn Tayan is from Aerfalle's Letter.</description>

One mystery remains, who shot the arrows? The Monougas aren't normally know for using bows or crossbows. hmm...

Here's the note you can find at this location:
Letter of Request

The Naquib of Suntik hereby requests all available mercenaries to assist in the purging our land of the fierce Mnougas. Our stronghold, located 16.2N x 4.4E, is under siege and supplies are low. Monougas are climbing the ridge near 18.5N x 3.6E and following it to our village. We can not hold out for long and our only hope is that this letter is found by a band of mercenaries with the will to help.</description>

The Old Redoubt:

In the 6th year of our freedom from the Olthoi, the people of Holtburg were besieged and slaughtered here by Tumeroks. Only the children were spared, thanks to the heroism of the mage Celcynd. This eternal flame burns in their memory, and their mortal remains have been left interred here in tribute. Disturb not their rest.

    <description>Quest(s): Slaying Pooky, Bunny Slippers, Son of Pooky.

Not aggressive unless IDed

VERY hard hitting (possibly hollow)

Casts bunny smite ( a spell that instantly kills anyone if they don't resist)

Very high health regeneration

Run speed is 700: 10-to-1 speeds indicate that this creature runs at 70 MPH.

Nicknamed 'Pooky' by the Turbine Developer Jesse "Devilmouse" Kurlancheek. 

Original version was added during the beta of Asheron's Call. It was updated after Maggie Jackcat's Campaign to 'buff the bunny' was a success, the campaign proposed that the rabbit should be updated to become a threat once more to the increasingly powerful playerbase

And the Lord spake saying:
First thou shalt take out the Holy Pin
Then shalt thou count to Three
No more, no less
Three shall be the number thou shalt count
And the number of the counting shall be Three
Four shalt thou not count
Neither count thou Two
Excepting that thou then proceed to Three
Five is right out!
Once the number Three, being the third number, be reached
Then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe
Who, being naughty in my sight
Shall snuff it.

Maynard: Amen

All:Amen

Arthur: Right

One, Two, Five!

Three, Sir!

Three!

Choir hymn

BOOM.

There is a gate to get inside, not sure if it is locked or not.

've heard tell of a strange purple stone in a cave south of Lin and west of Mayoi. It's guarded by nasty zefirs. There's also a book there, but no one I know has actually braved the zefirs to see what it's all about. If you want to try your luck, head northeast from the West Mayoi Mountain Villas.

    <description>Quest(s): Minor Atlan Stones.

This igloo in the frozen mountains contains the Minor Shivering Stone, but be warned, it is guarded by several Glacial Golems!

A pair of adventurers recently found a queer stone in the mountains to the north. They were returning from the assaults on the Frore, and became lost in a late blizzard. They took shelter in a small ice hut right on the edge of the Lost Wish Mountains, directly east of Holtburg and north of Cragstone. Inside they discovered a strange blue stone and a book. These seem to be artifacts of some lost form of Empyrean technology. Maybe you should investigate.

    <description>Quest(s): Green Mire Grave, Ice Tachi?.

Mosswarts are attracted to the swamps of this region. Near the Green Mire Grave dungeon, which is quite a ways north (and a tiny bit west) all the way over the river, there is a mosswart camp. One of them has a tachi that does ice damage. As you know, ice is useless against undead, but good against some other monsters. Don't go if you're new to the world, though. There are enough other dangers for a newcomer!

    <description>Quest(s): Knorr Quiddity Seed Ingot Purification.

Introduced in On Bended Knee.

This tree was long believed to be a Deru Tree, which was confirmed in The Beast With Many Heads in the Knorr Quiddity Seed Ingot Purification quest.

This tree grows atop the large cataracts overlooking the Chapel on Xi Ru's Island. To get to the tree, run west from the drop then north along the beach until you get to the Moarsmen Encampment at 60.1S 88.1W. From there, head south up the mountain all the way up to the Great Deru Tree at 89.8S 87.4E. The King's Crown water lily grows at the base of the tree. In The Beast With Many Heads, a dungeon was added that goes underneath the tree, Roots of the Deru Tree.</description>
